<h2 class="nobreak">I. CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDES TOWARD THE LAND</h2></div>

<p>Wisconsin in its racial character is popularly known to
the country at large as a Teutonic state. That means the
state has a German element, original and derivative, which
numerically overshadows the American, English, Irish,
Scandinavian, and other stocks also represented in the
Badger blend. It is not necessary to quarrel with this
widely accepted theorem, though some of the corollaries
drawn from it can be shown to be unhistorical; and one can
demonstrate statistically that if Wisconsin now is, or at any
census period was, a Teutonic state she began her statehood
career in 1848 as a Yankee state and thus continued for
many years with consequences social, economic, political,
religious, and moral which no mere racial substitutions have
had power to obliterate. My purpose in the present paper
is to present, from local sources, some discussion of the relations
of Yankee and Teuton to the land&mdash;a theme which
ought to throw light on the process of substitution mentioned,
revealing how the Teuton came into possession of
vast agricultural areas once firmly held by the Yankee.</p>

<p>The agricultural occupation of southern Wisconsin,
which brought the first tide of immigration from New
England, western New York, northern Pennsylvania, and
Ohio&mdash;the Yankee element&mdash;may be said roughly to have
been accomplished within the years 1835 and 1850. The
settlements which existed prior to 1835 were in the lead
region of the southwest, at Green Bay, and at Prairie du
Chien. The population of the lead mines was predominantly
of southern and southwestern origin; that of the two other
localities&mdash;the ancient seats of the Indian trade and more
recent centers of military defense&mdash;was mainly French-Canadian.
When, in 1836, a territorial census was taken,
it was found that the three areas named had an aggregate
population of nearly 9000, of which more than 5000 was in
the lead region included in the then county of Iowa. The
Green Bay region (Brown County) was next, and the
Prairie du Chien settlement (Crawford County) smallest.</p>

<p>The census, however, recognized a new county, Milwaukee,
whose territory had been severed from the earlier
Brown County. It was bounded east by Lake Michigan,
south by Illinois, west by a line drawn due north from the
Illinois line to Wisconsin River at the Portage, and north
by a line drawn due east from the Portage to the lake. In
terms of present-day divisions, the Milwaukee County of
1836 embraced all of Kenosha, Racine, Walworth, Rock,
Jefferson, Waukesha, and Milwaukee counties, nearly all of
Ozaukee, Washington, and Dodge, a strip of eastern Green
County, and most of Dane and Columbia. In that imperial
domain the census takers found a grand total of 2900 persons,
or almost exactly one-fourth of the population of the
entire territory.</p>

<p>Two significant facts distinguish the Milwaukee County
census list from the lists of Brown, Crawford, and Iowa
counties&mdash;the recency of the settlement and the distinctive
local origin of the settlers. These people had only just
arrived, most of them in the early months of 1836. One
could almost count on his ten fingers the individuals who
were there prior to the summer of 1835. In reality they were
not yet &#8220;settled,&#8221; for most of the rude claim huts&mdash;mere
shelters of the pre-log house stage&mdash;were haunted at night
and shadowed at noonday by men only, resident families
being still rare, though many were on the lakes, at the ports
of Milwaukee and Chicago, or on the overland trail which
was to end at the cabin door. It was the prophecy of new
communities, not the actuality, that the census taker
chronicled when he recorded the names of claim takers with
the number of persons, of each sex, comprising their households.
We have reason to believe that the numbers were
inscribed almost as cheerfully when the persons represented
by them were still biding in the old home or were en route
west, as when they were physically present in the settler&#8217;s
cabin or in the dooryard, eager to be counted.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_005.jpg" alt="WISCONSIN TERRITORY 1836" /></div>

<p>Unlike the other populations of Wisconsin at that time,
the vast majority of Milwaukee County settlers were
Northeasterners. Such evidence as we have indicates that
New York supplied more than half, the New England states,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan nearly all of the balance.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
New York&#8217;s title to primacy in peopling Wisconsin is exhibited,
most impressively, in the statistics of the 1850 census.
At that time native Americans constituted 63 per cent of
the total and New Yorkers had 36 per cent of the native
majority. Native Americans predominated in all but three
of the twenty-six counties, and in all but five those who were
natives of New York, added to the natives of Wisconsin,
were a majority of the American born. The exceptions were
the four lead mining counties of Grant, Iowa, Lafayette,
and Green, together with Richland, which, however, had so
few inhabitants that its case is divested of any significance.</p>

<p>The three counties which, in 1850, showed a majority
of foreign born inhabitants were Manitowoc, Milwaukee,
and Washington (the last named including the present
Ozaukee County); and in each case Germans constituted
more than half of that majority. Together those three
counties had over 20,000, which was considerably more than
one-half of all the Germans (38,054) domiciled in Wisconsin
at that time. The other lake shore counties, together with
Calumet, Fond du Lac, Dodge, Jefferson, and Waukesha,
accounted for 15,000 of the balance, leaving about 3000
scattered over the rest of the state. Thus the area embraced
by Lake Michigan, Lake Winnebago and lower Fox River,
the upper reaches of Rock River, and the south boundary
of Jefferson, Waukesha, and Milwaukee counties was all
strongly and in the main distinctively German.</p>

<p>Investigating the causes which may have operated to
concentrate the German population within such clearly
defined geographic limits, our first inquiry concerns the
land on which settlement was taking place. And here we
find that the distinguishing fact marking off the region in
which Germans abounded from most of the other settled or
partially settled areas of the state was its originally thickly
wooded character. In a way almost startling, and superficially
conclusive, the German settlements coincided with
the great maple forest of southeastern Wisconsin, spreading
also through the included pine forest on Lake Michigan
south of Green Bay.</p>

<p>Returning now to the Yankee element, we find that
although it was strong in all of the settled districts save the
five counties named, it was more completely dominant in
some districts than in others. For example, in Walworth
County the northeastern states furnished 96.5 per cent of
the American population, while 3.5 per cent was furnished
by sixteen other states. The foreign born constituted less
than 16 per cent of the total.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Walworth County was a
section of the new &#8220;Yankee Land,&#8221; which included in its
boundaries also the counties of Racine and Kenosha, Rock,
and at that time parts of Waukesha and Jefferson. Nowhere
in that region were foreigners very numerous, and in many
localities non-English speaking foreigners were almost
scarce.</p>

<p>Physically, this new Yankee Land comprised those portions
of the prairies and openings of southern Wisconsin
which lay not more than from sixty to seventy-five miles
from the lake ports at Milwaukee, Racine, and Kenosha.
The region was just as characteristically &#8220;open country&#8221;
as that occupied so extensively by Germans was forested.
One land type, the glacial marsh or swale&mdash;good for hay and
pasture&mdash;was common to the two districts of country. But
for the rest, the Yankee&#8217;s land was all ready for the plow if
it was prairie, and if oak openings the labor of felling the
scattered trees and dragging them away before the breaking
team was comparatively light.</p>

<p>The German, on the other hand, in order to subdue his
land to the requirements of successful tillage, must attack
with ax, mattock, and firebrand each successive acre,
patiently slashing and burning, hewing and delving, till by
dint of unremitting toil extended over an indefinite number
of years his farm became &#8220;cleared.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shall we therefore repeat, as the sober verdict of history,
the statement often heard, that in settling this new country
the Yankee showed a preference for open land, the German
for woodland? On the face of the census returns that seems
to be the case, and if our evidence were limited to the census
such a conclusion would be well nigh inescapable. Fortunately,
he who deals with culture history problems of the
American West has this advantage over the Greenes and the
Lamprechts of Europe, that on such matters his evidence is
minutely particular, while theirs is general to the point of
vagueness. No one will doubt that the Yankee staked his
claim in the open lands because he preferred those lands on
account of the ease with which a farm could be made. The
question is, whether the German&#8217;s presence in the woods
rather than in the openings or on the prairies was with him a
matter of preference so far as land selection in itself was
concerned.</p>

<p>Timber for shelter, fuel, building, and fencing was an
important consideration to all settlers, including the Yankees.
In another connection I have shown, from the records
of land entries, that the Yankee settlers in a prevailingly
prairie township of Racine County took up first every acre
of forested land, together with the prairie lands and marsh
lands adjoining the woods, while they shunned for some
years the big, open, unsheltered prairie where farms would
be out of immediate touch with woods.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Rather than take
treeless lands near the lake shore, these settlers preferred to
go farther inland where inviting combinations of groves,
meadows, and dry prairie lands, or openings, could still be
found in the public domain. Only gradually did American
settlers overcome their natural repugnance to a shelterless,
timberless farm home&mdash;a repugnance justified by common
sense, but springing from the habit of generations. When,
for economic reasons, they began to settle on the open
prairies, the planting of quick-growing trees about the farmsteads
was always esteemed a work of fundamental utility.</p>

<p>Yankee agricultural settlers found special inducements
for going inland in search of ideal farm locations, in the glowing
advertisements of Yankee speculators who early pioneered
the open country far and wide. These speculators
concerned themselves primarily with water powers for
sawmill and gristmill sites and town sites. Yet power and
town sites both depended for their development on the
agricultural occupation of the surrounding country, and
this made the speculators careful to locate their claims in
areas of desirable lands which would soon be wanted. It
also made them doubly active in proclaiming to immigrants
the agricultural advantages of their chosen localities.</p>

<p>One may take up at random the land office records of
townships in the older Wisconsin, and in practically every
case find proof that the speculator was abroad in the land
before the arrival of the farmer. Along the banks of navigable
rivers he took up, early, such tracts as seemed to afford good
steamboat landings, which might mean towns or villages
also. Along smaller streams he engrossed potential water
powers. In the prairie regions he seized the timbered tracts
which commonly lay along the streams. And wherever
nature seemed to have sketched the physical basis for a
future town, there he drove his stakes and entered an area
large enough at least for a municipal center.</p>

<p>In some portions, particularly of the earliest surveys, the
speculator also absorbed a goodly share of the best farm
land, which he held for an advance when the immigration of
farmers became heavy. Other Americans, aside from
Yankees, participated in these speculations, but the records
show that the Yankee&#8217;s reputation for alertness and sagacity
in that line is not unmerited. For illustration, the plats of
Dane County townships disclose among the original entrymen
who bought their lands early, the names of well known
speculators like James D. Doty, Lucius Lyon, the Bronsons,
Cyrus Woodman, Hazen Cheney, and C. C. Washburn&mdash;all
Yankees. In addition, we have distinguished New Englanders
who probably never came west but invested through
the agency of their Yankee correspondents. Among them
are Daniel Webster, Edward Everett, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
and Caleb Cushing.</p>

<p>To a considerable extent these speculators, in paying for
government lands, employed military land warrants, usually
purchased at a heavy discount. &#8220;Scripping&#8221; by this means
became more common after the Mexican War. A German
immigration leader wrote at the close of 1848: &#8220;There is a
man living in Sheboygan who has already placed 344 of these
warrants [each good for 160 acres] on government lands and
intends next spring to place 200 more on tracts lying north
of Fox River.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He did not say the man was a Yankee;
possibly he deemed that information unnecessary. For,
although the German sometimes bought warrants of the
brokers in order to save the difference between the price of
such warrants and the land office price of government land,
he did not in the early years of the immigration speculate
in farm lands.</p>

<p>Therein was one of the outstanding differences between
him and the Yankee. The German could not be tolled
into the interior by golden promises of unearned increments
from the sale of city lots, of mill sites, or of choice farm
lands which were going rapidly. His caution and his
phlegm were a protection. He was not particularly responsive
to the optimistic prophecies of the development of this
region or that region in which this company or that prominent
individual had interests. For these reasons, the German&#8217;s
motives as a land seeker were more legitimately
economic and social than were those of the Yankee, and on
the basis of such motives we can explain his settlement in
the woods.</p>

<p>In his homeland the German villager loved the forest for
its shelter, its recreational hospitality, and the benefits it
conferred in necessary fuel, timber, bedding, and forage.
A large proportion of the early German immigrants came
from south German provinces dominated by such famous
old forests as the Schwartzwald and the Odenwald. From
considerations both of habit and of economy it was natural
that in the New World they should make sure of an abundance
of timber on the lands they sought for future homes.
Yet, there is no reason to assume that the German, any more
than the Yankee, courted the grilling labor of clearing
heavily forested land&mdash;a labor to him the more formidable
for the want of the Yankee&#8217;s training in axmanship and his
almost unbroken tradition of winning fields from forests.
Some German pioneers who were self-helpful struck for the
openings and the prairies, and like the Yankee chose for
their farms the ideal combination of wood, marsh, and open
land whenever such a combination could be found within
easy reach of the market.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But Germans were less venturesome than Yankees, or
more prudent, depending on the point of view. In the old
home they were accustomed to haul their farm produce
many miles in going to the markets and fairs. But there the
roads were passable at all seasons. In the New World,
where all was in the making, the roads were often impassable
and always&mdash;except in winter&mdash;so rough and troublesome
as to daunt those who were not to the manner born.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Hence the German settler&#8217;s idea of what constituted a safe
distance from the lake ports within which to open a farm
differed from the Yankee&#8217;s idea. There is one striking illustration
of that difference. Along the Illinois boundary from
Lake Michigan westward was the strip of prairie and openings
twenty-four miles wide and seventy-eight long which
was divided into Racine and Kenosha counties (on the
lake), Walworth, and Rock. We have already called that
region the new Yankee Land and have seen the Yankee
farmers spread over it with seeming disregard to distance
from the lake ports, each being intent rather on finding an
ideal combination of desirable kinds of land. The three
divisions of the strip contained almost equal numbers of
Yankees&mdash;these people evidently believing that canals,
roads, plank roads, and railways would come to them when
needed, while a good farm location once lost was gone
forever; and being willing also, until such improvements
should come, to haul their crops sixty or seventy-five miles
to market. Not so the few Germans who entered this
Yankee Land prior to 1850. More than four-fifths of them
were in the section nearest the lake (Racine and Kenosha
counties), and less than one-thirtieth in Rock County, the
farthest west of the strip.</p>

<p>The movement into the prairies and openings of the
southeast had been going on for about four years before
the Germans began coming to Wisconsin, and so many
selections of first choice, second choice, and even third
choice land had been made that newcomers were already
at a disadvantage in that region, especially if a number of
them desired to settle near together in a body, which was
the case of Old Lutheran congregations who made up the
earliest German immigrations. Moreover, most of the
Yankees were business-like farmers who generally planned
for fairly large farms, in order to make money by raising
wheat. They were mainly men who had sold small farms
in the East in order to secure larger, or sons of large farmers.
Most of them had money or credit to enable them to acquire
land, construct buildings and fences, buy stock, and begin
farming operations. Having found good land by canvassing
the whole region, they were not to be dislodged until,
with the failure of wheat crops at a later time, the spirit of
emigration sent numbers of them to fresh wheat lands
farther west, thus making opportunity for well-to-do
Germans to buy their improved farms, which they did to
a great extent.</p>

<p>Meantime, the forested lands pivoting on Milwaukee,
the most promising of the lake ports, were open to entry at
the land office or to purchase at private sale on easy terms.
The Yankee had not altogether shunned those lands. There,
as elsewhere, he had been looking for good investments,
and the project for the Milwaukee and Rock River Canal,
which was to traverse a portion of the forested area through
the present Milwaukee, Waukesha, and Jefferson counties,
favored speculation in farm lands as well as in mill sites
and town sites. Besides, there is evidence that some of
the poorer Yankee immigrants who felt unable at once to
maintain themselves on open land farms, often settled
first in the woods, where they began making improvements
with ax and fire, only to sell out promptly at an advance
and go to the prairie or openings to establish permanent
farms. But most of the forested land was still &#8220;Congress
land&#8221; when the Germans began coming to Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The German &#8220;Pilgrims,&#8221; as the first colony was called,
arrived at Milwaukee early in October, 1839, their leader
being Henry von Rohr. Within a month they had decided
on a location, in the western part of township 9, range 21
east (the town of Mequon, Ozaukee County), and had
made numerous purchases of government land. They
selected a tract of high, rolling land, heavily timbered, well
watered, and with an extensive marsh near by in the public
domain which would furnish free hay and pasture.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The
situation was similar to that which was chosen, near Watertown
(in the town of Lebanon), a few years later by a
German colony from the same region. They also took a
tract of heavily timbered upland neighbored by an extensive
marsh. &#8220;Here,&#8221; said their leader, &#8220;we have both wood and
hay&#8221; (&#8220;<i>Holz und Heu</i>&#8221;).<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Many of the colonists in these two congregations were
very poor. Those who had means lent to the indigent to
enable them to emigrate. For them it would have been
madness to go to the prairies, where such absolute necessities
as fuel, building material, and fencing might cost ready
money and at best would be difficult to procure. In the
woods trees cut on the spot were used to build cabin and
log house, stable, garden and field enclosure. Some of the
German families were months without draft ox or even
cow. All work was performed by hand, including the carrying
of logs from the spot where the trees were felled to the
place where they were to be rolled up to make the cabin
wall. To such settlers, bringing timber from a distance
would have been among the impossibilities. Their place
was in the forest, where labor alone was required for making
the beginnings of a self-sustaining home.</p>

<p>In thousands of later instances, Germans who came to
Wisconsin on their own slender means were in a similar
case to these early seekers of religious freedom. An immigrant
of 1848, J. F. Diederichs, has left a diary and
letters from which the process of home making in the
woods can be reconstructed.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Diederichs, after considerable
search, found eighty acres of good government land
nine miles from Manitowoc, where early in winter he settled
down to work alongside of several other Germans who
were as poor as himself. The location was favorable, being
near a port. &#8220;What good is there,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;to possess
the finest land and be 6, 8 or 10 days journey from market.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The first step was to build a cabin, the next to bring his
family from Milwaukee and with a few dollars borrowed for
the purpose to lay in supplies for them. Then he erected a
comfortable log house and continued clearing till, by the
middle of May, he had two acres ready partly for garden
and partly for potatoes, corn, and beans to provide the
family with food. Diederichs realized that &#8220;to begin such
work at the age of 44 is some job,&#8221; and recognized that not
he and his wife but the children would be the chief beneficiaries.
Nevertheless, the joy of creation was not wholly
denied him. He had, he said, the &#8220;prettiest&#8221; location;
house set on a commanding knoll, with a pure limpid stream
flowing within a few yards of it, along whose course was
some open land, making a &#8220;layout for the finest pastures.&#8221;
And there was timber enough on his eighty to be worth
$30,000 in the home town of Elberfelt. Of this, he would
gladly make his friends in Germany a present of about
$20,000 worth!</p>

<p>The question of nearness to market was a determinant
also in the cases of Germans who were well enough off to
take open lands. William Dames found, for himself and
associates, a favorable tract near Ripon. It contained 160
acres prairie, 320 acres openings, and 160 acres of low
prairie or meadow land. The advantages of that neighborhood,
he wrote, were these: first, the prospectively near
market, by way of the Fox River Canal to be completed
the following spring; second, the excellence of the soil;
third, the ease with which the land could be made into
productive farms. There one need not subject himself to
the murderous toil incident to farm making in the woods.
And, fourth, the healthfulness of the climate and the superb
drinking water.</p>

<p>One bit of information which Dames conveyed to his
fellow Germans who were contemplating immigration to
Wisconsin, was that the Yankees (by which term he
described all native Americans) and the Scotch settlers of
that neighborhood were becoming eager to sell their partly
improved farms, preparatory to moving into the newer
region north of Fox River. He advised Germans able to do
so to buy such farms, which were to be had in plenty not
only in Fond du Lac County but near Watertown, near
Delafield, and even near Milwaukee&mdash;prices varying with
the improvements, nearness to the city, etc. He seemed to
think the Germans but ill adapted to pioneering. Let the
German immigrant, he said, buy a partly cleared farm; then
he could follow his calling in ways to which he was accustomed.
Moreover, since such farms produced fairly well
even under the indifferent treatment accorded them by
the Yankee farmers, the German farmer need have no fear
of failure.</p>

<p>The advice to purchase farms already begun was widely
followed by the financially competent German immigrants.
Ownership records of one Milwaukee County township show
that the lands were originally taken mainly by Irish and
Americans, yet in 1850 nearly one-half of the settlers were
Germans; and there is no reason to regard that case as
singular. Probably the Germans who bought improved
farms were as numerous as those who bought Congress
land. Many poor men worked as farm hands for some
years and then bought small improved farms in preference
to buying Congress land.</p>

<p>The experience of an 1849 immigrant, Johannes Kerler,
illustrates the less common case of Germans who arrived
with considerable means. Kerler brought with him to
Milwaukee a sum, derived from the sale of a profitable
business, which would have enabled him to buy scores of
mill sites and town sites in the public domain. Instead, he
limited his investment to a 200-acre farm seven miles from
the city, paying for the land, including all crops and livestock,
$17 per acre. The buildings consisted of a log house
and a cabin. One-half the farm was divided between plow
land and meadow; the balance&mdash;100 acres&mdash;supported a
dense forest growth. Kerler at once erected a barn for his
cattle, and a good two-story frame house for the family.
Then he went to farming and quickly transformed the
earlier crude homestead into a fruitful and beautiful farm,
the show place of the neighborhood.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Social forces are among the imponderables, and yet
their influence in controlling the distribution of immigration
must have been considerable. The fact that nearly all
incoming Germans landed in Milwaukee, where were
acquaintances and often friends, tended in a hundred subtle
ways to attach the newcomers to that community. Before
1850 Milwaukee had come to be looked upon as a German
city. &#8220;There,&#8221; said one immigrant, &#8220;more German than
English is spoken.&#8221; It had its German churches, schools,
clubs, societies, and recreational features, all of which
constituted powerful attractions. It was the most important
industrial center of the state, with a relatively large
demand for the labor which with farm work was the poorer
immigrant&#8217;s sole means of getting a financial start. In
addition, it was the commercial metropolis, and that the
German was firmly tethered to his market has already become
clear.</p>

<p>The construction of the Milwaukee and Mississippi
Railroad, begun in 1849 and completed to Prairie du Chien
in 1857, partially freed the German immigrant from his
dread of being marooned in the interior. Desirable government
lands accessible to the proposed railroad were generally
taken up several years before the completion of the road,
and among the entrymen in certain districts were many
newly arrived Germans. This was true to some extent in
Dane County, but more noticeably so farther west. In Iowa
County and in Grant were sheltered pleasant and fertile
valleys, opening toward the Wisconsin, which would be
served by the railroad when completed, and which had long
been in touch with the world by means of steamers plying
on the Wisconsin. In those valleys, and on the wider ridges
between them, the Germans competed with others for the
choicest locations on government and state lands. Land
entry records for two townships in Blue River valley show,
by 1860, out of an aggregate of 122 foreign born families 59
of German origin, while the American families numbered
93. A similar proportion doubtless obtained in other towns
south of the river.</p>

<p>Directly opposite these townships, in the same survey
range but lying on the north side of Wisconsin River, was
the town of Eagle, whose settlement was almost exactly
contemporaneous with that of the Blue River valley. But
Eagle, in 1860, had 20 foreign born families to 108 American,
and of the 20 only 13 were German.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the people on the two banks of the river
had a common market&mdash;Muscoda, which was a station on
the railroad&mdash;and the lands of Eagle were more fertile and
quite as well watered, the question why the Germans avoided
that town and made homes south of the river is surely
interesting, and possibly significant.</p>

<p>There were two important differences between the two
districts. In Blue River the valley land, to use the surveyor&#8217;s
phrase, was &#8220;thinly timbered with oak,&#8221; while in
the valley of Mill Creek, or Eagle Creek, opposite was a
dense forest dominated by the sugar maple but containing
big timber of several varieties, and dense undergrowth.
In a word, it was a heavily timbered area. Now the Germans
near Lake Michigan had given ample proof of gallantry
in attacking forest covered farms, yet when the
choice was before them of taking such land in Richland
County or easily cleared land of poorer quality in Grant,
almost with one accord they selected the latter.</p>

<p>We cannot be certain that the difference in the timbered
character of the land was the sole motive determining the
choice, though doubtless it was the most important. The
railroad ran on the south side of the river and the principal
trading center was on that side. Settlers in Blue River
valley could therefore reach the market by a direct, unbroken
haul with teams over public roads. Those in Eagle
at first were obliged to use the ferry in crossing the river,
and later they had to cross on a toll bridge except in midwinter,
if the river was frozen to a safe depth, when they
crossed on the ice. These transportation conditions might
have deterred some Germans from settling north of the
river, even if the lands there had been as lightly timbered
as those on the south side. Taken together, the two causes
virtually served to blockade that district against settlers of
their type.</p>

<p>But if the Germans declined the rôle of foresters, by
refusing to settle in a partially isolated town like Eagle,
the Yankees did the same. New Yorkers and New Englanders
were scarcer there than Prussians or Hanoverians. The
town was occupied mainly by families from Ohio, Kentucky,
Missouri, Indiana&mdash;with a few from Virginia and North
Carolina; in short, by men who had enjoyed or endured
a recent experience as frontiersmen in heavily wooded
regions. So many belonged to the class described by Eggleston
in <i>The Circuit Rider</i>, <i>The Hoosier Schoolmaster</i>, and <i>The
Graysons</i>, that the name &#8220;Hoosier Hollow,&#8221; applied to one
of the coulees, seems perfectly normal.</p>

<p>To the Yankee, we may be sure, the heavy woods in the
town of Eagle were a sufficient deterrent to settlement
there. The Germans shunned it either because they disliked
heavy clearing when it could be avoided and when no
compensating advantages offered, as was the case near the
lake shore; or because they disliked the risk and the expense
of crossing the river to market; or for both of these reasons
combined. Probably either reason, singly, would have
sufficed.</p>

<p>By way of summary, we may say that as a land seeker the
Yankee&#8217;s range exceeded that of the German. Both clung to
the lake ports as their market base. But the Yankee&#8217;s
optimism painted for him a roseate future based on an
experimental knowledge of material development for which
the German&#8217;s imagination was largely unprepared. The
New Yorker had witnessed, in his home state, the almost
miraculous transformation of rural conditions through the
construction of a system of canals; and canal building
affected Vermont, Pennsylvania, and Ohio only less profoundly
than the Empire State. To the Yankee, therefore,
who cast his lot in the favored lands of Wisconsin it seemed
that nothing could halt the march of improvement. The
chief point was to obtain prompt possession of the right kind
of farm. Having this, he could count on doing a big agricultural
business as a wheat grower, which promised generous
financial rewards. But if for any reason he failed to get
the right kind of farm, if improvements were unexpectedly
dilatory, or if the land ceased to respond to his demand for
wheat and more wheat, he &#8220;sold out&#8221; with slight compunction
and went elsewhere, confident of success on a new
frontier, especially the great wheat plains. To him land was
a desirable commodity, but by no means a sacred trust.</p>

<p>The German, on the other hand, came from a land of
very gradual change. Although agricultural conditions
there were actually considerably modified in the first half
of the nineteenth century, he still, for the most part, looked
upon his dwindling patrimony as the basis, not of a money
making business, but of a livelihood. If, by the combined
labor of all members of the household, the family
could be fed, clothed, and sheltered, the heavy obligations
to church and state redeemed, and a few <i>gulden</i> sequestered
for times of emergency, the peasant was content.
His land was his home. It had been his father&#8217;s, grandfather&#8217;s,
great-grandfather&#8217;s. The original estate was
parted into ever more and smaller divisions, as generation
succeeded generation, until the tracts of many holders were
at last too small to support the families. These had no
choice but to sell and go to the city, or go to America. This
condition was one of the most general economic causes of the
large German immigration to this and other states. When
the German farmer, or other German, came to Wisconsin
and bought a piece of land, one purpose dominated his
mind&mdash;to make a farm for a home, and establish a family
estate. In the beginning it did not occur to him to speculate
in land, although in this as in other things he proved an apt
pupil. Accustomed to a very limited acreage, he was not
like the Yankee ambitious to secure a large domain. Habituated
to intensive tillage, a partly made farm having ten
or twelve acres of cleared land was to him an ample equipment
for making a living in agriculture. Enlarging fields
meant a surplus and mounting prosperity. If he took raw
land, he could count on clearing enough in a couple of
winters with his own hands to raise food crops, and he
looked upon the prospect of spending ten, twenty, or
twenty-five years in fully subduing his 80- or 100-acre farm
with no unreasoning dread or carking impatience. The remark
of Diederichs characterized the German preëmptor:
&#8220;If I once have land enough under cultivation to raise our
food supplies, I will win through.&#8221; Whereas the Yankee
wanted to break 40, 60, 80, or 100 acres of prairie or openings
the first year, the German contemplated the possession of a
similar acreage of tillable land in ten, fifteen, or twenty
years.</p>

<p>But once in possession of a tract of land, the German
tended to hold on, through good years and bad years, as if
his farm were the one piece of land in the world for him and
his. The Yankee, already given to change in the East,
tended in the West, under the stimulus of machine-aided
wheat culture, to regard land lightly, and to abandon one
tract for another on the principle that the supply was
inexhaustible and that one social environment was apt to
be as satisfactory as another. He had before him the great
wheat plains, the Pacific coast, the inland empire and the
parks of the Rocky Mountains. Latterly his range has
widened to include the plains of the Assiniboin, the Saskatchewan,
and Peace River. For more than half a century he
was free to roam, to pick and choose land even as he picked
and chose in southern Wisconsin&mdash;the slower, more cautious,
or more timid German buying his farm when he was ready to
sell.</p>

<p>It was peaceful penetration, involving no sabre rattling
but much canny bargaining, sober casting up of accounts,
and cheerful jingling of specie. The Yankees, more speculative
to the last, more imaginative and space-free, pressed
ever toward the borders of the primitive, drawn by the same
lure of wealth quickly and easily acquired which brought so
many of them to the prairies of Wisconsin in the earlier
days. The Germans, fearing distance more than debt, confident
in their ability to make grain crops grow and farm
stock fatten if only they had a sure market for cattle and for
crops, remained behind to till the abandoned fields and
occupy the deserted homes. Thus, so far as Wisconsin&#8217;s
farming areas are concerned, the shadow of the Yankee has
grown less in the land, while the tribe of the Teuton has
increased.</p>

<p>What tendencies may have been induced by the passing
of the frontier and the resurgence of a population deprived
of its former temptation to expand into new regions; what
social changes were implied in the agricultural revolution
which compels the daily application of science to the business
of farming; what readjustments in relationships were
involved in the modification of the Teutonic type with the
coming upon the stage of the second and third generations
of Germans; how the Germans in turn have reacted to the
competition of groups having their origin in other foreign
countries, like the Scandinavians, Bohemians, and Poles&mdash;all
these are questions the answers to which would aid us to
determine &#8220;where we are and whither we are tending.&#8221;
But their discussion will have to be postponed to later issues
of this magazine.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II. DISTINCTIVE TRAITS AS FARMERS</h2></div>

<p>The agricultural traits and peculiarities of the nineteenth
century Yankees were the resultant of partly contradictory
forces, some of them evolutionary, others devolutionary.
In England the period of the Puritan migration to America
and the half-century antecedent thereto was a time of
vigorous agricultural change marked by many improvements
in cultivation and in land management. The agrarian
revolution introduced by the transfer of church properties to
laymen was accompanied by enclosures and a widespread
tendency to shift from an uneconomical crop economy to an
agriculture governed by business principles. In this new
system the production of farm animals&mdash;especially sheep&mdash;the
fertilization of the soil, rotation of crops, and livestock
improvement were main factors. Forces and interests were
set in motion at this time which, a century or so later, made
farming the concern of many of England&#8217;s leading minds,
whose wise and persistent experimentation benefited the
whole civilized world.</p>

<p>The few thousand immigrants to the New England colonies,
founders of America&#8217;s Yankeedom, were not all farmers.
Some were fishermen, some were small tradesmen, others
craftsmen; a few were professional men and soldiers. But a
goodly proportion were land owners and peasants, and all
had a more or less direct knowledge of the principles and
processes which governed English agriculture. The influence
of habit, always a determining factor in the transfer
of civilization from an old land to a new, caused the occasional
reproduction in New England of some features of
English farming, especially under village conditions. The
common field system in Old Salem reflected a disappearing
element in English farm life, while the commons of hay,
commons of pasture, commons of wood, and commons of
mast, with their administrative &#8220;hay reeve,&#8221; &#8220;hog reeve,&#8221;
&#8220;wood reeve,&#8221; herdsmen, and shepherds, mark a natural
imitating of the ways of parish life at home.</p>

<p>But there were differences in the conditions &#8220;at home&#8221;
and in America as wide as those symbolized by the terms
&#8220;insular,&#8221; and &#8220;continental,&#8221; applied to the geography of
the two countries. Chief among these differences were the
generally forested character of the new-world land, the
necessity of adapting tillage to an unfamiliar climate, in
part to new food cereals, especially Indian corn, and the
absolute dependence upon markets which could be created
or opened by the colonists themselves. It was in fact the
problem of a market which so long subordinated farming
proper in New England to a species of country living in
which small patches of arable supplied most of the family&#8217;s
food, while forest and stream were the objects of exploitation
for marketable furs, for medicinal plants, and for timber
products. Yankee ingenuity, which justly became proverbial,
had an assignable cause. It was not an inherited
quality, or one which was imported and conserved; it was a
distinctively American product, explained by the situation
of the average New England farmer&mdash;who was, by force of
circumstances, more of a mechanic and woods worker
than a cultivator of the soil. His house, especially in winter,
was a busy workshop where clapboards, staves, hoops,
heading, ax handles, and a variety of other articles of
utility and salability were always in course of manufacture.
All the farm &#8220;tinkering&#8221; was additional thereto.</p>

<p>In his contest with the forest for a livelihood, the Yankee
farmer was gradually changed from the eastern New England
village type to that of the American &#8220;pioneer.&#8221; His
axmanship was unrivaled, his skill in woodscraft, his resourcefulness
in the face of untried situations were equal to
the best. When the time came for taking agricultural possession
of broad spaces in the northern and western interior,
the Yankee was the instrument, shaped by four generations
of American history, to achieve that object.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>This general &#8220;handiness&#8221; was gained not without a
partial loss of such acquired knowledge and skill in agriculture
proper as the first immigrants brought from England.
Close, careful cultivation was impossible among the stumps
and girdled trees of new clearings; the amplitude of natural
meadows and the superabundance of &#8220;browse&#8221; relieved
settlers from the sharp necessity of providing artificially
for the winter feeding of cattle; the mast of oak trees and
the wealth of nuts, supplementing summer &#8220;greens,&#8221; roots,
grass, and wild apples, supplied most of the requisites for
finishing off pork. Under these conditions farming even
at best was an entirely different thing from what it had
been at home. At its worst, it was a crude process, affording
a vegetative kind of existence, but nothing more. In
fact, farming in the New England states hardly attained the
status of a business until the nineteenth century, though
in some portions it gave the farmer and his family a generous
living and afforded a few luxuries. It made thousands of
persons independent proprietors who could not have reached
that station at home; it gave the farmers as a class a commanding
influence in politics and society; &#8220;embattled,&#8221; it
enabled them to wrest their country&#8217;s independence from
the awkward hands of a bungling monarchy. In short, it
contributed incalculably to their importance as men in
history. The indications are, however, that as farmers the
fourth generation of <i>Mayflower</i> descendants were decidedly
inferior to the original Pilgrims and Puritans.</p>

<p>The third generation were probably less skillful than the
fourth. For, by the time of the Revolution there were
farming areas in southern New England that were looking
up. Timothy Dwight, near the end of the century, found
and recorded some of the evidences of a movement to improve
cultivation, to fertilize the soil, to better the character
of farm livestock&mdash;a movement which had been going forward
under impulses communicated from England, where
the eighteenth century was peculiarly fruitful in agricultural
development. Dwight was enough of an idealist to appreciate
the limits of the improvement thus far reached.
Yet he did insist, with evident justice, that the farming of
the Connecticut valley and of eastern Massachusetts was at
least respectable. Fields were well cleared and carefully
cultivated, clover began to be used as a feeding and green
manure crop, the beginnings had been made of a system of
rotation of crops, livestock was of relatively good quality&mdash;especially
in certain Connecticut towns which were already
noted for the weight of the bullocks they furnished to the
commissary department of Washington&#8217;s army. By that
time, also, leading men in New England lent their influence
toward the building up of the agricultural interest; agricultural
societies were organized and essays on agriculture came
to have considerable vogue. Some importations of purebred
livestock from England took place. The first merino
sheep were brought in from France, then larger numbers
from Spain by Consul William Jarvis. In 1810 Elkanah
Watson established his Berkshire County Agricultural
Society, with the county fair which became the model for
subsequent county and state fairs the country over.</p>

<p>When Tom Paine predicted in 1776 that an independent
America would prosper &#8220;as long as eating continues to be
the custom of Europe,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> he assumed one point about which
some doubt might in future arise: Would Europe always
have the wherewithal to purchase American foodstuffs at
prices which would compensate our people for growing
them and delivering them to the market? During the
continuance of the long revolutionary and Napoleonic wars,
Europe managed to make good Paine&#8217;s prophecy, and
prices at the close of the wars ruled high. There followed
the great expansion era which spread American farmers
over the New West, both south and north, into which
Yankees entered to a large extent.</p>

<p>The good prices did not hold. Food could be raised
cheaply, but markets were costly to reach, even with the
new wizardry of the steamboat, and something gigantic
was called for in the way of internal improvements. The
answer was at first canals, afterwards railroads. At the
same time, something had to be done by the farmer himself
if the entire structure of American agriculture, now becoming
conscious of its own embarrassments, was not to go
down. The answer to this was <i>better farming</i>. It was in
1819, the panic year, that John S. Skinner founded at
Baltimore the <i>American Farmer</i>, first of the distinctively
farm journals which almost immediately had a small group
of successors. Among them were the <i>New England Farmer</i>,
the <i>Albany Cultivator</i>, the <i>Pennsylvania Farmer</i>, the <i>Rural
New Yorker</i>, the <i>Vermont Farmer</i>, the <i>Ohio Farmer</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Yankeedom was a good social soil for these journals.
The all but universal literacy of the people, their curiosity,
their love of argument and disputation, their habit of
experimentation, all tended both to give currency to the
new ideas presented and to sift the practical and valuable
from the merely theoretic and futile. Thus was introduced,
in a period of prevailing &#8220;hard times,&#8221; a meliorating
influence destined to reach a very large proportion of the
settlers in those sections, particularly Vermont, western
New York, northern Pennsylvania and Ohio, from which
the bulk of the Yankee pioneers of Wisconsin were drawn a
quarter of a century later. The effect of county and state
fairs was to deepen and fructify the influence of the new
agricultural press.</p>

<p>It will be understood that the actual &#8220;shoring up&#8221; of
agricultural practice came about with relative slowness.
Yet, it soon began here and there, and by a kind of mild infection
spread gradually over wide areas. Only in crisis
periods, with the introduction of new methods to suit new
market conditions, was progress ever very rapid. To
illustrate, as early as 1820 Josiah Quincy was advocating
and practising the summer soiling of cattle, especially
milch cows, and demonstrating the profitableness of the
system for the region near Boston. It was a long time
before soiling became common even in that district, but
this experiment engendered better care of livestock. The
same careful, experimental farmer demonstrated the economy
of using good-sized whole potatoes for seed, as against
the practice of planting seed ends and small tubers; other
farmers were slow to adopt the idea, which is not yet universally
followed, yet some improvement doubtless came
from the publication of Quincy&#8217;s findings.</p>

<p>What, then, were the general farming habits of the
Yankees who form the background of Wisconsin&#8217;s pioneer
age? First of all, they lived in decent houses which were
usually of lumber. Dwight contended that not one New
England village in a hundred was disfigured with the presence
of even one log house. He also gives the result of a
count made in 1810 of the log houses along the road from
New Haven to Windsor in Vermont, thence across the
Green Mountains to Middlebury, and back by a direct
route to New Haven, a distance of over 460 miles, much of
it through new settlements. It showed only fifteen to
Middlebury and thirty-two on the return route. It seems
to have been a matter of pride with the Yankee to desert
his pioneer log house as quickly as possible. His personal
skill with tools, and abundance of saw timber, made the
construction of a frame house a family undertaking calling
for labor indeed, but only a minimum of hired skill; and
for little material involving the outlay of actual money. So
the frame houses rose wherever the Yankees settled. Along
the great road from Albany to Buffalo, in western New
York, they began to spring up before the settlements were
ten years old. When, about twenty-five years later,
travelers passed that way they saw many houses of squared,
framed timbers, covered over neatly with boards at the
sides and ends, and roofed with shingles.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> These common
frame houses were sufficiently inartistic, no doubt. Perhaps,
as one traveler remarks, they did look like &#8220;huge
packing boxes.&#8221; Similar architectural designs can be
seen scattered over the West&mdash;and the East, too&mdash;at this
late date. Still, they were more commodious than the
log houses, and improved the families&#8217; living conditions.
The next stage was likely to mark a very distinct advance.
&#8220;In the more cleared and longer settled parts of the country,&#8221;
says a none too sympathetic English traveler, &#8220;we
saw many detached houses, which might almost be called
villas, very neatly got up, with rows of wooden columns in
front, aided by trees and tall shrubs running round and
across the garden which was prettily fenced in, and embellished
with a profusion of flowers.&#8221; Yankees had the
habit of building by the roadside, whatever the economic
disadvantages of such a situation, because it enabled them
to keep in touch with the world&mdash;a reason which is by no
means frivolous, and for them highly characteristic.</p>

<p>We have no such definite account of the Yankee farmers&#8217;
barns as of those of Pennsylvania Germans. It is true that
Dwight, speaking for the older New England, suggests
that the barn was apt to be a much better structure than
the house. The custom, however, noted by travelers in
New York and elsewhere, of letting cattle run at large all
winter without shelter other than trees and brush, and perhaps
the straw pile or rick of marsh hay, argues that stabling
was furnished for only a minimum number of work oxen,
horses&mdash;if such there were&mdash;and perhaps in some cases cows
in milk. It undoubtedly was not the practice to house stock
cattle, or even&mdash;except in isolated cases&mdash;to feed them in
sheds. The advocates of careful sheltering who wrote for
the agricultural journals recognized that the weight of
opinion was against sheltering stock. They compromised
with that opinion by recommending sheds for young stock
and dry cows, and warm barns only for milking cows and
work animals.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Yet, some of the leading cattle feeders
of the Genesee valley, as late as the year 1842, were content
to scatter loads of hay over meadows and through brush
patches for the hundreds of beef cattle they were wintering.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The livestock, except sheep and pigs, was still by 1840
prevailingly of no breed. Nevertheless, Durhams and
Devons were coming into use. The Patroon stock of
shorthorns, introduced in 1824 from England by Stephen
Van Rensellaer, of Albany, gained its first customers apparently
among the English farmers of western New York,
but gradually made its way among the Yankees as well.
Other importations were soon made, so that by 1840 there
were several prominent herds of purebreds in that section
of the state. In 1842 it was said of the Genesee County Fair
that &#8220;with the exception of some working oxen and one
cow not a single animal of native cattle was in the yard.
All were either pure or grade Durhams or Devons....
Bulls were shown by some six or seven competitors. Among
them were four thoroughbred ones and one of those imported.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
It is clear that by the time emigration to Wisconsin
began to take place, actual progress had been made
and the entire body of Yankee farmers had been indoctrinated
with the idea of better livestock. Sheep and pigs
were already largely improved, the former prevailingly
through the cross with the merinos, the latter with Berkshires
and other English breeds. The Morgan horse, a
Vermont product, was gaining wide popularity.</p>

<p>From what has been said of the care of livestock, it
follows that the possibilities of the farm for the manufacture
of fertilizer were generally neglected. English travelers
were apt to insist that this neglect was universal, but there
were, of course, numerous exceptions. Farming was extensive,
not intensive. Lands were cleared by chopping or
&#8220;slashing&#8221; the timber, burning brush and logs, then harrowing
among the stumps to cover the first-sown wheat seed.
In a few years, with the rotting of the smaller stumps and
the roots, the plow could be used, though always with embarrassment
on account of the large stumps which thickly
studded the fields. These disappeared gradually, being allowed
to stand till so fully decayed that a few strokes with
ax or mattock would dislodge them. As late as 1830 many
fields in western New York were stump infested.</p>

<p>Wheat was the great, almost the sole, market crop,
and it was grown year after year till the soil ceased to
respond. From bumper yields of twenty-five or thirty
bushels per acre the returns fell off to twenty, fifteen, and
then twelve, ten, or even eight. The process of decline was
well under way when the immigration to Wisconsin set in,
and already the turn had come toward a more definite
livestock economy, which in large portions of New York
soon gave rise to a system of factory cheese making. A
main reason for the removal to the West, on the part of
farmers whose holdings were too small to make successful
stock farms, or who refused to abandon wheat raising as a
business, was that lands in the West could be had already
cleared by nature. Many half-cleared farms, with customary
buildings and fences, could in the forties be purchased in
western New York for from four to eight dollars per acre.
Instead of buying these farms, the young men preferred
going to Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, or Wisconsin, those having
such farms for sale doing likewise after selling out to neighbors,
usually the larger farmers, who elected to remain
and change their system of farming. In Vermont we have
a similar story, in Ohio the same. The Yankee farmers who
came to Wisconsin were generally at home either small
farmers or the sons of farmers large or small; while a certain
proportion of the larger farmers, by reason of debt or desire
to extend their business, also sold out and came west to buy
cheap lands on the prairies or in the openings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An agriculture which dates from before the time of
Tacitus, and which acquired permanent characteristics from
the influence of Roman merchants, monastics, and feudatories
in Roman and medieval times, was bound to differ
widely and even fundamentally from the agriculture of a far
flung American frontier. The Germans who met the
Yankee immigrants in primitive Wisconsin brought an
inheritance of habit and training analogous to that of the
English Puritan emigrants to New England, but with the
difference that the Germans&#8217; training had continued two
hundred years longer, on similar lines. They were old-world
cultivators, the Yankees new-world cultivators.</p>

<p>Tacitus says in one place: &#8220;The Germans live scattered
and apart, as a spring, a hill, or a wood entices them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Nineteenth century German economists complained that
German farmsteads were seated often most inconveniently
with reference to the management of the farm lands pertaining
to them. They had been established, in the days
of long ago, by lakeside, brook, or river under conditions
in which access to water was the most important single
consideration. They had never been moved, although
gradually the arable stretched far back from the dwelling,
and the pasture perhaps was located in a wholly detached
area.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This description applies to portions of northern
Germany where farms were large and farming had the status
of a regular and dignified business.</p>

<p>Many individuals and families came to Wisconsin from
districts like Mecklenburg, Prussia, Pomerania, though in
the emigrations of the 1840&#8217;s and fifties the great majority
were from southern and central German states. It will be
one of the interesting inquiries in connection with our study
of local influences in Wisconsin towns (<i>Domesday Book
Studies</i>), how far the special regional inheritances of foreign
born settlers manifested themselves in Wisconsin communities.
The presumption, about the north German,
would be that his farming operations would tend to be on
a large scale, under a business system which&mdash;in this new
land&mdash;would slough off such anachronisms as the dislocated
farmstead, and present the features of an ideal establishment.
But it may be that the forest was such a powerful
leveler as to obliterate most of the regional distinctions
among immigrants. Our chief concern, at all events, is
with that great body of German farmers, and intending
farmers, who came from the southwestern states of the recent
Empire, especially Alsace, Baden, Württemberg,
Rhine Palatinate, Rhenish Prussia, Hesse, Nassau, Westphalia&mdash;to
some extent Bavaria and Saxony.</p>

<p>The fundamental facts about the home conditions of these
people, so far as they were farmers at home, were the smallness
of their holdings, their intensive cultivation, and the
almost universal village type of life. Travelers of about
1840 describe the typical middle Rhine country as a highly
cultivated plain without division hedges or fences other
than the tree-bordered roads, with no separate farm dwellings
and with no livestock in sight. The crops of several
kinds being arranged in various shaped fields, patches, and
strips, the plain looked like the proverbial &#8220;crazy-quilt.&#8221;
Villages were huddled at the edges of woods, and occasionally
in the midst of the cultivated area. Their houses,
which were not arranged on a regular plan, were usually
large stone structures, the farm yard, with tools, implements,
manure and compost heaps, occupying a kind of
court at the rear.</p>

<p>As a rule, all animals were housed winter and summer.
Here was an important difference to the farming of the
north, where large herds of cattle could be seen pasturing
ample meadows, or ruminating in the shade of buildings
or of woods. The soiling system was universally practiced
in summer. Grass land being scarce and precious, feed
for the cows was laboriously gathered along the brookside, in
the open spaces of the forest, along all the roads, in the
cemeteries, and the greens before the houses. The weeds
and thinnings from the growing crops went to the same
object. Vegetable tops were a great resource in late summer
and fall, and patches of clover, while insuring green feed,
furnished hay as well. In places the growing of sugar
beets for the market was a leading agricultural enterprise,
and the tops of the beets were carefully cured for winter
feed.</p>

<p>The cultivation was intensive both in that it aimed at
the maximum produce from given areas, and in that the
crops raised included some which called for very special
care. Some sections grew tobacco, in connection with
which much hand work was indispensable. This crop
also called for care in seed selection, in germinating, and in
preparing the ground for the reception of the young plants.
Beet culture for sugar making involved perhaps not less
care, and doubtless more hand labor. Of similar but less
particularity was the growing of root crops for stock feed,
the orcharding, which was general, and the vine dressing,
incident to the business of special districts.</p>

<p>There were, of course, many farmers and farms in the
region indicated and in other contributory regions, which were
not so widely different from the average of those in America.
Yet, on the whole, it can be said that the German husbandman,
in training and habit, was analogous to our modern
truck farmer or orchardist, rather than to our general
farmer. He was a specialist in soils, in fertilizing and preparing
them for different crops, in planting, stirring, weeding,
irrigating; in defending plants against insect pests, seasonal
irregularities, and soil peculiarities; he throve by hoeing,
dragging, trimming, pruning, sprouting; by curing and conserving
plants, roots, grasses, grains, and fruits. His livestock
economy was incidental, yet very important. It
supplied the necessary fertilizer to maintain soil productivity;
it afforded milk, beef, pork, butter, cheese, wool.
It gave him his draft animals, often cows instead of oxen,
and economized every bit of grass and forage which his situation
produced.</p>

<p>Improvement of livestock appears to have affected
southwestern Germany prior to 1850 very little as compared
with the pastoral countries of England, Holland, Friesland,
and north Germany. The animals kept by the village
farmers were therefore not remarkable for quality. But
they were usually well housed, and the feed and care they
received made up in considerable measure for the absence of
superior blood.</p>

<p>The various states of Germany, by 1840, were maintaining
schools of agriculture, a species of experiment stations
for the dissemination of such scientific agricultural information
as was then available. To some extent, therefore,
farming was beginning to be scientific. But, prevailingly
it was intensely practical, the appropriate art connected
with the growing of every distinct crop being handed on
from father to son, from farmer to laborer.</p>

<p>One could almost predict how farmers thus trained
would react to the new environment of the Wisconsin
wilderness. Taking up a tract of forested land or buying
a farm with a small clearing upon it, their impulse would be,
with the least possible delay, to get a few acres thoroughly
cleared, subdued to the plow, and in a high state of tilth.
Exceptions there were, to be sure, but on the whole the
German pioneers were not content to slash and burn their
timber. After the timber was off, the stumps must come
out, forthwith, to make the tract fit for decent cultivation.
Was it the Germans who introduced in land clearing the
custom of &#8220;grubbing&#8221; instead of &#8220;slashing&#8221;? This meant
felling the tree by undermining it, chopping off roots underground
at a safe depth, taking out grub and all, instead of
cutting it off above ground. In timber of moderate growth
this practice proved fairly expeditious and highly successful,
for once a tract was grubbed, the breaking plow encountered
no serious obstruction. A good &#8220;grubber&#8221;
among later immigrants could always count on getting jobs
from established German farmers.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>To the American, who was content to plow around his
stumps every year for a decade, to cultivate around them,
cradle or reap around them, it seemed that his German
neighbor was using some kind of magic to exorcise his
stumps. The magic was merely human muscle, motivated
by a psychology which inhibited rest so long as a single
stump remained in the field.</p>

<p>The German not only used the heaps of farm yard
fertilizer which, on buying out the original entryman, he
commonly found on the premises, but he conserved all
that his livestock produced, and frequently, if not too
distant from town or village, became a purchaser of the
commodity of which liverymen, stock yard keepers, and
private owners of cow or horse were anxious to be relieved.
The manufacture of fertilizer was a prime reason for stabling
his livestock. The other was his fixed habit of affording
animals such care. Not all Germans built barns at once,
but the majority always tried to provide warm sheds, at
least, whereas Yankee and Southwesterner alike were very
prone to allow their animals to huddle, humped and shivering,
all winter on the leeward side of house or granary, or in
clumps of sheltering brush or trees.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The German was
willing to occupy his log house longer, if necessary, in order
to gain the means for constructing adequate barns and
sheds.</p>

<p>Germans were not one-crop farmers. The lands they
occupied, usually forested, could not be cleared fast enough
at best to enable them to raise wheat on a grand scale, as
the Yankees did in the open lands of the southeast and
west. Their arable was extended only a few acres per
year, and while that was being done the German farmers
grew a little of everything&mdash;wheat, rye, corn, oats, barley,
potatoes, roots. Clover was to them a favorite forage, hay,
and green manure crop. In growing it, they used gypsum
freely. This policy of clover growing, adopted gradually
by all farmers, was one of the means finally relied on by
the wheat farmers to restore the productivity of their
abused soils.</p>

<p>In ways such as the above, German farmers helped to
save Wisconsin agriculture in the period of stress when
wheat growing failed and before coöperative dairying
entered. They were not the chief influence in popularizing
improved livestock. Credit for that innovation must be
awarded to the Yankees. They had resumed in the eastern
states the English tradition of breeding, and brought it into
Wisconsin where, by means of state and county fairs and an
active agricultural press, it was ultimately borne in upon
the minds of all farmers, Germans among the rest.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Neither did the Germans lead in developing the new
agriculture, of which coöperative dairying was the keystone.
Yankee leadership therein, too, was the dominant
influence. Yet, it was the Germans, Scandinavians, and
other foreigners&mdash;and numerically Germans were in the
majority&mdash;who, by virtue of their agricultural morale,
their steadiness in carrying out plans, their patience and
perseverance, have made the dairy business of Wisconsin the
great industry it has become.</p>

<p>Above all, the Germans persisted as farmers. They
prospered not dramatically, like some of the more successful
of the Yankee farmers, but by little and little they saved
money, bought more land, better stock, and built better
homes. When Yankee farmers, discouraged or impoverished
by the failure of wheat, offered their farms for sale
preparatory to &#8220;going west,&#8221; Germans who had managed
their smaller farms more carefully stood ready to buy; when
Yankees who were tired of being &#8220;tied to a cow&#8221; wanted to
go to Montana, Oregon, or Wyoming to raise steers by
wholesale, on the ranching plan, they sold out to Germans
who made the dairy farms pay larger dividends year by
year. When Yankee farmers retired to the city, or went
into business, which in recent decades they have done by
thousands, Germans were among those who were the keenest
bidders for their farm properties. In a word, the German
has succeeded agriculturally through the more and more
perfect functioning, in this new land, of qualities imparted
by the training and inheritance which he brought with
him from the old world. On the whole, Germans have kept
clear of speculation, preferring to invest their savings in
neighboring lands with which they were intimately familiar,
or to lend to neighboring farmers on farm mortgage security.
In the aggregate, German farmers in Wisconsin have long
had vast sums at interest. The Institute for Research in
Land Economics (University of Wisconsin) has completed
investigations which show that the nation&#8217;s area of lowest
farm mortgage interest rates (5.2 per cent or less) coincides
very closely with the great maple forest of eastern Wisconsin,
which has been held, from the first, predominantly by
German farmers.</p>

<p>We have no desire to minimize the factor contributed to
Wisconsin&#8217;s agriculture by the Yankees. They were the
prophets and the organizers of the farmers&#8217; movement.
Their inherent optimism, their speculative bent, their
genius for organization were indispensable to its success.
&#8220;Anything is possible to the American people,&#8221; shouted the
mid-century American orator from a thousand Fourth of
July rostrums, therein merely reflecting what the mass of
his hearers religiously believed. When agriculture had to
be remade in Wisconsin, the Yankee&#8217;s intelligence told him
in what ways it must be improved, and his tact, courage,
and address enabled him to enlist and organize the means
for remaking it. When the Yankee was convinced, by his
farm paper or by the exhibitions, that a purebred animal
was a good investment, his speculative spirit sent him to his
banker to borrow a thousand dollars, and to a distant
breeder to make what his more timid German neighbor
would call a &#8220;mighty risky investment&#8221;&mdash;for the animal
might die! Finally, when local organization was required
to secure a cheese factory, a creamery, or a dairy board of
trade, the Yankee by virtue of his community leadership
was usually able to effect the desired result.</p>

<p>Wisconsin&#8217;s almost unique success in agriculture is due to
no single or even dual factor. But among the human elements
which have been most potent in producing the result,
none is of more significance than the fortunate blend in her
population of the Yankee and the Teuton.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III. SOME SOCIAL TRAITS OF YANKEES</h2></div>

<p>Harriet Martineau, the English traveler who in 1837
published a book entitled <i>Society in America</i>, was deeply
impressed with New England&#8217;s concern for education.
&#8220;All young people in these villages,&#8221; she says, &#8220;are more
or less instructed. <i>Schooling is considered a necessary of
life.</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> I happened to be looking over an old almanac one
day, when I found, among the directions relating to the
preparations for winter on a farm, the following: &#8216;Secure
your cellars from frost. Fasten loose clapboards and
shingles. Secure a good schoolmaster.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>We do not know what almanac Miss Martineau consulted.
But a glance at a file of the <i>Farmer&#8217;s Almanack</i>,
begun in 1793 by Robert B. Thomas and circulated by
him for more than half a century all over New England,
shows her quotation to be fully justified in spirit if not in
letter. As early at least as the year 1804, Mr. Thomas
included in his directions for the month of November, the
indispensable item of education in connection with other
activities: &#8220;Now let the noise of your flail awake your
drowsy neighbors. Bank up your cellars. Now hire a good
schoolmaster and send your children to school as much as
possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nation was young in 1804. Parts of it were new and
for that reason had made but meager educational progress;
other parts were backward for different reasons. But in
the older states of New England popular education had
flourished for one hundred and fifty years. This point,
stressed by a score of writers, illustrated by legal enactments,
court decrees, town records, and anniversary sermons,
cannot be over-emphasized in a summary of the social
contributions which the Yankees made to the new western
societies they helped to build. Notwithstanding all that
has been written to prove the priority, in this or that
feature of American educational progress, of other social
strains or geographical areas, history may confidently
assign to the Yankee priority in the attainment of universal
literacy on an extensive scale.</p>

<p>Once the Puritan had convinced himself that the
temptation to ignorance came from &#8220;ye old deluder Satan,&#8221;
whose fell purpose was to keep men from a knowledge of the
Scriptures and thus the more readily win them for his own,
he hesitated not to require the maintenance of schools in
all towns and neighborhoods under his jurisdiction. He
was also concerned to recruit an &#8220;able and orthodox ministry&#8221;
to take the places of the aging pastors who had
come from England and to supply the needs of new settlements.
Harvard College could turn out the ministers, if
it had properly prepared young men to work upon. So
the larger towns were required to maintain grammar
schools in addition to the common schools. Thus we have,
as early as 1647, provision for schooling from the lowest
rudiments up through the college course.</p>

<p>The original religious motive for maintaining these
schools persisted. But other motives were added as the
Puritans perceived how notably secular interests, as well
as religious, were served by schooling. For one thing, young
persons who could read, write, and cipher had a distinct
advantage in worldly matters over those who could not.
Cheats and &#8220;humbugs,&#8221; of whom every community had
its share, made victims of the ignorant, while they fled from
the instructed even as their master, Satan, was supposed
to flee from them. Many New England stories were
designed to carry the lesson, especially to parents, that
the best legacy children could receive was good schooling,
without which wealth and property would quickly melt
away.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Apart, also, from such negative worldly advantages as
we have named, one who had enjoyed good schooling might
thereby hope to share in many special social privileges
from which the unlettered were debarred. New England
life on the religious side centered in the church, on the
civic side in the town. Each of the two institutions required
a full set of elective officers, ranked according to
the importance of the offices filled, and all of these were
chosen from the instructed portion of the community. To
be a deacon in the church or a selectman on the town
board might not be financially remunerative, but it imparted
a dignity to the individual and a social status to the family
which caused these offices to be highly prized. The older
theory was that only good churchmen could fill either
type of office. Gradually, the town offices, which paid
something in cash and yielded considerable political power,
came to be sought with increasing frequency by men who
might have no interest in the church. &#8220;Jethro Bass&#8221;
was typical, not unique, in his scheming to be chosen
selectman, and the training offered by the district school
was looked upon as a minimum basis for such preferment.
Said the <i>Farmer&#8217;s Almanack</i> for November, 1810: &#8220;Send
your children to school. Every boy should have a chance
to prepare himself to do common town business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great majority were satisfied with the elementary
training afforded by the district schools, kept for a few
months in winter. But the presence of learned men in
every community and the existence of secondary schools
and colleges tolled a good many on the way to advanced
instruction who had no plans for professional careers. From
farm, factory, and counting-room, even from among those
before the mast, went boys to academy and college, while
female seminaries springing up here and there took care of
the educational interests of selected groups of girls. Such
schools were not free, but their benefits were easy to attain,
the principal requisite being pluck and a willingness to
work both at earning money and at the studies. Girls
and boys alike could usually earn their way by teaching
in the common schools. Thus the educational system
propagated itself, with the result that men and women of
intelligence, culture, and refinement became widely dispersed
through Yankeedom, and learning was recognized
as an aid to the good life as well as a guarantee of the successful
life. This was a fundamental condition of that literary
flowering which marked the middle decades of the nineteenth
century. It insured the poets, historians, orators,
and novelists an audience which waxed ever larger as
province after province in the West was added to New
England&#8217;s spiritual empire.</p>

<p>Let us not, however, picture to ourselves a Yankee
society wholly suffused with intellectual and spiritual light.
The Yankees had no such illusions about themselves.
Listen to Timothy Dwight&#8217;s description of a class of New
Englanders who could not live &#8220;in regular society. They
are too idle, too talkative, too passionate, too prodigal,
and too shiftless to acquire either property or character.
They are impatient of the restraints of law, religion and
morality, grumble about the taxes by which rulers, ministers
and schoolmasters are supported&mdash;at the same time
they are usually possessed, in their own view, of uncommon
wisdom; understand medical science, politics, and religion
better than those who have studied them through life....&#8221;
He represents the type as the pioneering or <i>forester</i> class,
who had &#8220;already straggled onward from New England&#8221;
to far distant settlements, and whose going he was not
disposed to lament. &#8220;In mercy,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to the sober,
industrious, and well disposed inhabitants, Providence
has opened in the vast western wilderness a retreat sufficiently
alluring to draw them from the land of their nativity.
We have many troubles even now, but we should have
many more if this body of foresters had remained at home.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The above citation doubtless contains an element of
exaggeration, due to Dwight&#8217;s ingrained conservatism.
He was outraged by the radical views no less than by the
erratic and ignorant harangues he heard &#8220;by many a kitchen
fire, in every blacksmith&#8217;s shop, and in every corner of
the streets....&#8221; Yet we must not lose sight of the fact
that he here sketches for us some Yankee social traits
of rather extended application which were important in
the building of the West. These people belonged to the
outstandingly non-conformist type. They were sufficiently
independent&mdash;contemptuous, one might say&mdash;of
established customs and institutions to be willing, with
what ignorance or awkwardness soever, to bring about
changes, some of which were sadly needed. Religiously
they were apt to be <i>come-outers</i>. It was largely among
this class that were recruited the Millerites, Millennialists,
and original Latter Day Saints, together with many other
minor sects and factions. In politics, when all orthodox
New England was Whig, they were mainly Democratic;
many, however, backed the program of Nativism; in the
person of John Brown they exemplified the principle of
direct action as applied to slavery. The social innovator,
the medical quack, and the political demagogue found
among them welcome and encouragement, sometimes
to the temporary distress of society, often to its ultimate
benefit. Not unlike the original Puritans who represented
&#8220;the dissidence of dissent and the protestantism of the
protestant religion,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> they constituted a dynamic social
element although wanting in the intellectual and religious
training, the political morale, and perhaps the heroism
which distinguished the original planters of Massachusetts
Bay. They had the spirit of the revolutionary New Englanders,
who were described, not inaptly, as &#8220;hard, stubborn,
and indomitably intractable.&#8221; They were the backbone
of Shays&#8217;s rebellion. In many ways they illustrate the
qualities which, at various times in our later history, have
served as the fulcrum of revolutionary change.</p>

<p>Dwight&#8217;s <i>foresters</i> were merely the extreme manifestation,
the caricature, of a much larger class of heady, self
sufficient, opinionated, and troublesome persons who equally
with the sober, church going, instructed, conformist type
were the product of New England conditions. The cords
of restraint were drawn so taut in the parishes and towns,
that the person who was determinedly &#8220;different&#8221; was
compelled to break them and become a kind of social
pariah in order to gain the freedom his soul craved. It
was not an accident that so large a proportion of that class
went to the frontier. They found there a less rigorous
church discipline, freedom from taxes for the support of the
established church, and a more flexible state of society in
the midst of which they might hope to function. In western
Massachusetts and Connecticut, in Vermont, New Hampshire,
and Maine, they were numerous at the opening of
the National period. Soon large numbers emigrated to
western New York, to northern Pennsylvania, to Ohio,
thence throughout the West. They made up an appreciable
part of the thronging Yankee immigration which seized
upon Wisconsin&#8217;s prairies and oak openings between 1835
and 1850, and their presence has left its impress upon our
social history. Still the experiences of older frontiers, such
as western New York, had already modified the type.</p>

<p>When all necessary deductions have been made, however,
the church remained equally with the school a dominant
note in the Yankee&#8217;s social landscape. His &#8220;meeting
house,&#8221; not infrequently in New England a gem of ecclesiastical
architecture, fulfilled his artistic ideal; the congregation
was the &#8220;household of faith&#8221; which claimed his
undeviating loyalty; the pastor was &#8220;guest and philosopher&#8221;
in his home whenever he chose to honor it with his presence.
To men and women alike, attendance upon the church
services was the principal Sabbath day duty and the
chief physical and mental diversion of the whole week.
It was an old custom to linger after the morning sermon
for a social chat either in the church yard, when the weather
permitted, or else at a near-by tavern; and while the talk
was ostensibly about the sermon, gossip, bits of practical
information, and even a shy kind of love making were often
interwoven, tending to make this a genuine community
social hour.</p>

<p>The tradition that the minister must be a man of
learning was of incalculable social importance. His advice
was called for under every conceivable circumstance of
individual and community need. He assisted about the
employment of schoolmasters and was the unofficial
supervisor of the school. He enjoined upon negligent
parents the duty of sending their children, and he had
an eye for the promising boys&mdash;lads o&#8217;pairts, as the Scotch
say&mdash;whom he encouraged to prepare for professional life.
He fitted boys to enter the academy and sometimes tutored
college students. In the rural parish the minister occupied
the church glebe, which made him a farmer with the rest.
He was apt to read more widely and closely in the agricultural
press, or in books on husbandry, than his neighbors,
thereby gaining the right to offer practical suggestions
about many everyday matters. Some ministers were
writers for agricultural journals. Many contributed to
local newspapers items of news or discussions of public
questions in which their parishioners were interested with
themselves.</p>

<p>The home missionary idea was inherent in the New
England system both as respects religion and education.
Older, better established communities always felt some
responsibility for the newer. Since settlement proceeded
largely by the method of planting new townships of which
the raw land was purchased by companies from the colonial
and state governments, it was possible for the larger community
to give an impetus to religion and education under
the terms of township grants. This was accomplished
by reserving in each grant three shares of the land&mdash;&#8220;one
for the first settled minister, one for the ministry forever,
and one for the school.&#8221; Other grants of raw land were
made for the support of academies. Here we have the
origin of the system of land grants in aid both of the common
schools and of state universities, in the western states.
The grants for religion necessarily were discontinued after
the adoption of the national constitution.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The religious unity established by the Puritans, and
maintained for a time by the simple method of rigorously
excluding those holding peculiar doctrines, gave way to
considerable diversity in the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries. Episcopalianism made some progress
in the older settlements, and Unitarianism created a great
upheaval, while toward the frontiers the Methodists and
Baptists flourished more and more. These several elements,
by 1820, were powerful enough politically to secure the
abolition of the ancient tax for the support of the established
(Congregational or Presbyterian) church&mdash;a tax which had
long caused ill feeling between West and East, and no
doubt had contributed to the growth of dissenting churches.
These frontier churches had the characteristics of the
frontier populations. Their ministers were less learned,
their morale less exacting, their religion less formal and
ritualistic, their ordinances less regularly and habitually
enforced. But there was an emotionalism which in a
measure compensated for defects of training, for looseness
of habit and negligence in the practice of religion. In a
word, the camp meeting type of Christianity prevailed
widely along the frontier, and that type entered Wisconsin
Territory with the numerous Methodist and Baptist settlers
from New York and New England. As early as August,
1838, such a camp meeting was held under Methodist
leadership in the woods near Racine; it was attended by
hundreds of pioneer families drawn from the sparsely
settled neighborhoods for many miles around. Its appointments
were of the typical frontier kind, though one would
expect less boisterousness in the manifestations of emotion
among those people than seems to have accompanied
similar gatherings in the Southwest.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The stated religious services in early Wisconsin, as in
every frontier region, were apt to be less frequent than in
older communities. Ministers were too few in number and
neighborhoods too impecunious to justify each locality in
supporting a minister. The circuit riding custom prevailed
generally among all denominations. One preacher traveled,
on foot, six hundred miles, making the round in six weeks.
Each group of churches also had its conferences, which
were occasions for planning missionary effort, for unitedly
attacking special religious or social abuses, and for promoting
constructive community effort. The ablest speakers
addressed such gatherings; the membership of the churches
concerned and others attended, in addition to the delegates;
and important religious, social, or moral results sometimes
flowed from them.</p>

<p>Another peculiar Yankee institution allied at once to
the school and the church, was the lyceum or local coöperative
organization for bringing lecturers to the community.
The settlements in southeastern Wisconsin had
their lyceums at an early date, and many distinguished
public men from the East had occasion to visit this new
Yankeeland in the capacity of lecturer. Among them were
Horace Greeley, Bayard Taylor, and James Russell Lowell.</p>

<p>Reform movements, however, though usually receiving
valuable aid from churches, lyceums, mechanics&#8217; institutes,
and other permanent organizations of men for public
discussion, had a way of creating special organizations to
propagate themselves. That was true of the temperance
movement, which by the time of the Yankee immigration
into Wisconsin was under vigorous headway. Beginning,
in serious form, about 1820, the intervening years witnessed
the creation of hundreds of local temperance societies in
New England and New York, and the federation of these
societies into state societies. These central organizations
stimulated the movement by sending out lecturers, conducting
a newspaper propaganda, and issuing special
publications. Some of their tracts are said to have been
scattered &#8220;like the leaves of autumn,&#8221; all over New England
and New York.</p>

<p>One of these tracts affected the social history of Wisconsin
very directly. It is known, traditionally, as &#8220;The Ox
Discourse,&#8221; because it was based on Exodus 21:28-29:
&#8220;If an ox gore a man or woman, that they die: then the
ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten;
but the owner of the ox shall be quit. But if the ox were
wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been
testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but
that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be
stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.&#8221; The
sermon on this text produced a great sensation and gained
many new adherents to the temperance cause. Among
these were two brothers, Samuel F. and Henry Phoenix,
who were storekeepers in a New York village and sold
much whisky. They publicly destroyed all the liquor
they had on hand and became crusaders in the temperance
cause. In the spring of 1836 Colonel Samuel F. Phoenix
selected in Wisconsin a &#8220;Temperance Colony claim,&#8221; on
which he settled that summer. Then he rode to Belmont
and induced the first territorial legislature to set off from
Milwaukee County a county to be known as Walworth,
in honor of the chancellor of the state of New York, who
was a noted temperance leader. He named the village
begun by him Delavan, in honor of E. C. Delavan, pioneer
temperance editor and at that time chairman of the executive
committee of the New York State Temperance Society.
Colonel Phoenix lectured on temperance, helped to organize
early temperance societies, rebuked his neighbors&mdash;especially
the New Yorkers&mdash;for employing whisky at raisings,
and, before his death in 1840, had succeeded in giving
a powerful impulse to the movement in southeastern
Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Another dramatic figure in early temperance annals
was Charles M. Goodsell, who in 1838 settled at Lake
Geneva and built the first mill operated in Walworth
County. He was of Connecticut birth, and his father
owned and managed, among other properties, a whisky
distillery. Goodsell, however, when he came west from
New York State, was a most determined opponent of the
traffic in intoxicants. Soon after opening his mill a local
company erected in Lake Geneva a distillery for making
corn whisky. Goodsell warned them, he says, not to
expect him to grind their grain and they installed a grinding
apparatus of their own. But, their machinery proving
inadequate, they finally sent a grist of corn to Goodsell&#8217;s
mill, demanding, as under the law they had a right to do,
that it be &#8220;ground in turn.&#8221; Goodsell refused, thereby
producing a tense situation, for the pioneer farmers looked
to the distillery as a cash market for their grain. Finally,
the distillers brought suit, won a verdict, and Goodsell
appealed. But meantime, he rode to Madison, where the
legislature was sitting, and procured the adoption of an
amendment to the law regulating milling, to the effect:
&#8220;Nothing in this section contained shall be construed to
compel the owners or occupiers of mills to grind for distilling,
or for sale or merchant work.&#8221; This proviso, adopted in
1841, remained a feature of the statute for many years.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>It must not be supposed that pioneer Yankee society,
even in Walworth County, was prevailingly of the temperance
variety. All testimony, both of the reformers and of
others, tends to show that a large majority was at first in
the opposition. Frontier history would indicate that
excessive indulgence in whisky was apt to be more common
during the primitive phase of settlement than later, due
perhaps to the looser social and religious organization.</p>

<p>Wisconsin may be said to have been born to the temperance
agitation which, in a few years&#8217; time, produced
societies pledged to total abstinence all over the southeastern
part of the state and in many other localities. In March,
1843, a legislative temperance society was organized with a
list of twenty-four signers. The house of representatives
at the time had twenty-six members, the council thirteen,
or a total of thirty-nine. So a decided majority was aligned
with the movement. Moses M. Strong was chosen president,
which was considered a triumph for the cause, and
much interest was aroused by the adherence of William S.
Hamilton, who is reported to have addressed one of the
society&#8217;s meetings.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The temperance agitation everywhere received a notable
impetus from the adoption in 1851 of the prohibition law
by the state of Maine. Immediately other states moved
for the same objective, and in Wisconsin a referendum vote
was taken in 1853 which resulted favorably to prohibition,
though no enactment followed.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In that election the
southeastern counties were overwhelmingly for the Maine
law. Walworth gave 1906 votes for it and 733 against,
Rock 2494-432, Racine 1456-927. Milwaukee at the same
time voted against prohibition by 4381 to 1243. This
shows where was to be found the powerful opposition to
legislation of this nature, which was destined to increase
rather than diminish with the strengthening of the German
element already very numerous.</p>

<p>From the time of the Maine law agitation the communities
dominated by Yankees were generally found
arrayed in favor of any proposal for limiting or suppressing
the liquor traffic, although, as we shall see in later articles,
no large proportion of their voters ever joined the Prohibition
party. They did not succeed in abolishing drunkenness,
though it became very unfashionable to indulge heavily
in spirituous liquors and the proportion of total abstainers
among the younger generation steadily increased. Yankees
furnished a very small per cent of those who gained their
livelihood through occupations connected directly with
intoxicating liquors, except as such traffic was carried on
incidentally as a feature of the drug business. The disfavor
with which saloon keeping, brewing, and distilling have
long been regarded among that class of the population is
explained by the fervor and thoroughness of the early
temperance campaigns.</p>

<p>Because of their attitude on the liquor question, on
Sunday laws, and other matters pertaining to the regulation
of conduct, the Yankees have always been looked upon
by other social strains as straight-laced and gloomy. In
this judgment men have been influenced more than they
are aware by the traditions of Puritanism which it was
supposed the Yankees inherited. They recalled the story
of how Bradford stopped Christmas revelers and sent them
to work; they pictured Puritan children as forbidden to
laugh and talk on the Sabbath day; and some may have
heard the story of how Washington, while president, was
once stopped by a Connecticut tithing man who must be
informed why His Excellency fared forth on the Lord&#8217;s
Day instead of resting at his inn or attending public worship.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Two remarks may be made on this point. First, while
Puritanism unquestionably had a somber discipline, there
was not lacking even among Puritans the play instinct
which persisted in cropping out despite all efforts of the
authorities at repression. Second, the nineteenth century
Yankees register a wide departure from early Puritanism
in their social proclivities, and the difference was particularly
marked in the West. Even church services were
modified to fit the needs of the less resolute souls. Music
became an important feature and it was adapted more or
less to special occasions.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Sunday Blue Laws were gradually
relaxed, though never abandoned in principle. Well-to-do
city people allowed themselves vacation trips, visits to watering
places, and to scenic wonders like Niagara Falls.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In town
and country alike dancing became an amusement of almost
universal vogue, though protested by some religionists,
and rural neighborhoods found bowling such a fascinating
game for men and boys that the almanac maker thought
well to caution his readers against over-indulgence therein.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Ball playing, picnicing, sleighing, coasting, skating were
among the outdoor sports much indulged in by Yankees,
while family and neighborhood visiting, the quilting bee,
donation parties, church socials, and the like furnished
indoor recreation. The circus and the &#8220;cattle show&#8221; were
events in the western Yankeeland equal in social significance
to Artillery Day in Boston.</p>

<p>Thus, while it is true that Yankees were a sober people,
of prevailingly serious mien and purpose, they were not
averse to the relaxations of play and recreation. The
question whether or not the Yankees were fun loving
cannot be answered by yes or no. If we mean by fun the
rollicking joviality characteristic of irresponsible, carefree
folk, the answer is no. Many Yankees found their best
fun in work or business. To the David Harum type, which
was fairly numerous, a horse trade was more fun than a
picnic. Some Boston merchants were so immersed in their
business that, though very pious, they nevertheless spent
Sunday afternoon going over their books and writing
business letters.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Being serious minded, they tended to
make their chief concern an obsession, and could hardly
be happy away from it. But the majority were quite as
ready to amuse themselves out of working hours, as are
the Italians or other social stocks that have a reputation
for fun and frolic.</p>

<p>The Yankees also found intellectual enjoyment in cultivating
quickness of retort, in giving utterance to clever
if homely aphorisms, and in a kind of whimsical humor.
These traits emerge in their vernacular literature like
&#8220;Major Jack Downing&#8217;s&#8221; <i>Thirty Years out of the Senate</i>,
and especially Lowell&#8217;s <i>Biglow Papers</i>. &#8220;The squire&#8217;ll have
a parson in his barn a preachin&#8217; to his cattle one o&#8217; these
days, see if he don&#8217;t,&#8221; said one of &#8220;Tim Bunker&#8217;s&#8221; shiftless
neighbors by way of summarizing the squire&#8217;s over-niceness
in caring for his Jersey cows. &#8220;Ez big ez wat hogs dream
on when they&#8217;re most too fat to snore&#8221;; &#8220;that man is mean
enough to steal acorns from a blind hog&#8221;; &#8220;the coppers
ain&#8217;t all tails&#8221;; &#8220;pop&#8217;lar as a hen with one chicken&#8221;; &#8220;quicker&#8217;n
greased lightnin&#8217;&#8221;; &#8220;a hen&#8217;s time ain&#8217;t much&#8221;; &#8220;handy
as a pocket in a shirt&#8221;; &#8220;he&#8217;s a whole team and the dog
under the wagon&#8221;; &#8220;so thievish they had to take in their
stone walls at night&#8221;; &#8220;so black that charcoal made a
chalk mark on him&#8221;; &#8220;painted so like marble that it sank
in water&#8221;&mdash;the above are all Yankeeisms of approved
lineage and illustrate a characteristic type of Yankee humor.
The example below is of a rarer sort. &#8220;Pretty heavy thunder
you have here,&#8221; said the English Captain Basil Hall to a
lounger in front of a Massachusetts tavern. &#8220;Waal, we do,&#8221;
came the drawling reply, &#8220;considerin&#8217; the number of the
inhabitants.&#8221;</p>

<p>About the time that Yankees began to emigrate to
Wisconsin a talented French writer, Michel Chevalier, gave
the world a brilliant and on the whole favorable characterization
of them. &#8220;The Yankee,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is reserved,
cautious, distrustful; he is thoughtful and pensive, but
equable; his manners are without grace, modest but dignified,
cold, and often unprepossessing; he is narrow in his
ideas, but practical, and possessing the idea of the proper,
he never rises to the grand. He has nothing chivalric
about him and yet he is adventurous, and he loves a roving
life. His imagination is active and original, producing,
however, not poetry but drollery. The Yankee is the
laborious ant; he is industrious and sober and, on the
sterile soil of New England, niggardly; transplanted to
the promised land in the west he continues moderate in
his habits, but less inclined to count the cents. In New
England he has a large share of prudence, but once thrown
into the midst of the treasures of the west he becomes a
speculator, a gambler even, although he has a great horror
of cards, dice, and all games of chance and even of skill
except the innocent game of bowls.&#8221; Chevalier also says:
&#8220;The fusion of the European with the Yankee takes place
but slowly, even on the new soil of the west; for the Yankee
is not a man of promiscuous society; he believes that
Adam&#8217;s oldest son was a Yankee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Yankee was not more boastful than other types of
Americans, though his talent for exaggerative description
was marked. Yet he had a pronounced national obsession
and was uncompromising in his patriotism: &#8220;This land
o&#8217;ourn, I tell ye&#8217;s got to be a better country than man ever
see,&#8221; was put into a Yankee&#8217;s mouth by one of their own
spokesmen and represents the Yankee type of mild jingoism.
It is full cousin to that other sentiment which also this writer
assigns to him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Resolved, that other nations all, if set longside of us,</div>
<div class="verse">For vartoo, larnin, chiverlry, aint noways wuth a cuss.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>These are but cruder expressions of ideas dating from the
Revolutionary War, and of which Timothy Dwight, who
was not a poet by predestination, gave us in verse a noble
example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise,</div>
<div class="verse">The queen of the world, and child of the skies!</div>
<div class="verse">Thy genius commands thee; with rapture behold,</div>
<div class="verse">While ages on ages thy splendors unfold.</div>
<div class="verse">Thy reign is the last, and the noblest of time,</div>
<div class="verse">Most fruitful thy soil, most inviting thy clime;</div>
<div class="verse">Let the crimes of the east ne&#8217;er encrimson thy name,</div>
<div class="verse">Be freedom, and science, and virtue, thy fame.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It need not be supposed that all Yankees who came to
Wisconsin or other western states were familiar with these
glowing lines. But it is almost certain that, in the common
schools of Yankeedom, most of them had thrilled to the
matchless cadences of Webster&#8217;s reply to Hayne. What
more was needed, by way of literary support, to a pride
of country which, if a trifle ungenerous to others, was based
on facts all had experienced.</p>

<span class="smcap">Joseph Schafer</span></p>


<h2 class="nobreak">IV. SOME SOCIAL TRAITS OF TEUTONS</h2></div>

<p>The year 1832, celebrated in Wisconsin history as the
time when the lead miners and other pioneers destroyed the
power of the Rock River Indians, was remembered by later-coming
German immigrants for a very different reason. It
was toward the end of March in that year, the place Trier
(Treves), the ancient capital of the western &#8220;Cæsars,&#8221; a city
which is still rich in the massive ruins of its Roman foretime.
As the story goes, the boys of one form in the old <i>Gymnasium</i>
were being entertained at the house of a professor, where,
boy-like, they were playing indoor games accompanied with
much laughter and general hilarity. Suddenly one of their
younger classmates rushed breathless into the room, exclaiming:
&#8220;Goethe is dead!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> During the balance of the evening,
the less serious of the youngsters having returned to their
interrupted play, this boy engaged with his instructors in
eager discussion of Goethe&#8217;s life and writings.</p>

<p>The youth in question was Karl Marx, whose later history
exhibits a wide divergence from the exclusively literary career
prophesied by his boyhood scholastic interests. The classmate
who is authority for this incident continued in Marx&#8217;s company
the <i>Gymnasium</i> studies; he then performed his one year
minimum of military service, and having secured some business
experience sailed away as an immigrant to the new world,
settling on a Wisconsin farm. In the course of a long life he
often reverted to the story of Goethe, whose works, as well as
those of Schiller and Lessing, made a part of his home library.
These great names never failed to kindle his pride in the
intellectual achievements of the German people, whose
governments at the time of his emigration in 1841 seemed to
him a compound of despotism and inefficiency.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless there were Germans of the immigration to Wisconsin
who knew not Goethe, or if in a hazy way they did
know who he was, had no intellectual right to judge his
merits. But the more intelligent were sure to possess some
knowledge of the writings of their greatest poet and of lesser
men who still were great in the world&#8217;s estimation. Hence it
was that Germans who at that period went to the new world,
while acknowledging by their flight the political, economic,
and social obstacles to a successful life in Prussia, Bavaria,
Baden, Westphalia, or Luxemburg, were always able to
maintain a self-respecting attitude when confronted with the
pretensions of those Americans who were unsympathetic,
jingoistic, or boastful. German immigrants might grant
much to superior cleverness, to the stupendous achievements
of a liberty loving race, domiciled in a peaceful continent and
dowered with free lands and boundless opportunity; but they
remembered that <i>William Tell</i> and <i>Faust</i> and <i>The Laocoön</i>
were written by Germans.</p>

<p>Though many immigrants were far from being literary,
they doubtless possessed, on the average, a knowledge of
German masterpieces fully equivalent to the knowledge
which Americans possessed of the English Classics. For education
was looking up, and while most of the immigrants
from German states, like those from other European countries,
were of the peasant class, which was usually the most
backward, still by 1840 nearly all were sure to have enjoyed
some systematic schooling. At an earlier period this might
have been otherwise. The condition of limited serfdom, removed
but a generation earlier, operated powerfully to neutralize
such benevolent plans for universal instruction as kings
and ministers proclaimed. For the peasants were directly
subordinate to the local lords, who often felt &#8220;that an ignorant
labor supply was less likely to seek to better its condition
by demands upon them....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The great national reform
movement which came to fruition after the close of the Napoleonic
wars swept away many of the disabilities of the common
people, and developed in Prussia and other states a
system of universal education as the surest means of national
upbuilding.</p>

<p>The excellencies of the Prussian school system prior to
1840 became the theme of flattering reports on the part of
educators in many lands. The celebrated philosopher Victor
Cousin made it the basis for his plan of educational reform in
France; the Scotch, English, and Irish discussed it; Horace
Mann proclaimed it to the school authorities of Massachusetts,
and Calvin E. Stowe recommended it to the legislature
of Ohio. That system may not have possessed all of the
virtues which the ordinances quoted by Cousin imply.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Yet
it had the one excellence to which educationally all others are
subsidiary&mdash;a well-trained teaching force. Indeed, if there
is anything which seems miraculous in the swift and thoroughgoing
transformation of school conditions in Prussia during
the first forty years of the nineteenth century, it is explained
by the provision which the state made for normal schools and
the supply, through their agency, of teachers enough to man
all the schools. &#8220;In the lowest school in the smallest and obscurest
village,&#8221; says Horace Mann, &#8220;or for the poorest class
in overcrowded cities; in the schools connected with pauper
establishments, with houses of correction or with prisons&mdash;in
all these there was a teacher of mature age, of simple, unaffected
and decorous manners.&#8221; Mann also made it clear
that every such teacher was possessed of adequate scholarship
and special training for the work of the schoolroom.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Such a
statement could not be made at that time about Massachusetts,
where popular education was already two hundred years
old, nor could it be made with equal confidence of other
German countries, though several of these approximated the
Prussian standard and most of them were earnestly promoting
education along the same lines and by the use of similar
means.</p>

<p>We must therefore regard the generation of the German
exodus from which Wisconsin profited so largely in the later
1840&#8217;s and the 1850&#8217;s, as almost universally literate and usually
well grounded in the rudiments of an education. The
intelligent, reading, writing, and slow but careful figuring
German peasant immigrants constituted the best testimonial
to the efficacy of German systems of instruction for the common
people. The <i>Gymnasia</i>, the <i>real Schule</i>, the universities,
sent forth representatives of the highest German culture to
honor the learned professions, the literary, philosophical, and
scientific circles of America.</p>

<p>On the basis of formal school instruction alone, the historian
of early Wisconsin would be compelled to assign first
place in social fitness to the immigrants from Germany.
Neither the Irish, the English, nor even the Yankee pioneers
on the average had enjoyed as thorough a training as had
Prussians, Saxons, Hessians, or Badeners. Yet, school training
is never all there is of education, and it may constitute but
a small portion of it. No one questions that the social character
of Prussian and other German peasants was far higher in
1840 than it had been in 1800, and this was due to a variety of
causes, of which schooling was only one. In part it was due
to the abolition of serfdom, in part to the reorganization of
municipal life; also, largely to the religious agitation of the
period, to the movements for political reform, and especially
to the widespread, momentous, and gripping spirit of nationalism.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, despite their superb educational equipment
plus other incentives, the Prussians still seemed to intelligent
American observers in a very retarded social condition.
Horace Mann, who wrote most enthusiastically of their
schools and was sympathetic toward the Germans in every
respect, in a passage of almost classic force and beauty written
in 1843, tells us why education in Prussia accomplished
for the people so much less than one might expect. For one
thing, he says, the pupils left school too early&mdash;at the age of
fourteen, which was their time for beginning regular and
heavy work. Then, too, books for further self-instruction
were lacking. There was in Prussia nothing analogous to the
Massachusetts district school libraries. &#8220;But,&#8221; he continues,
&#8220;the most potent cause of Prussian backwardness and incompetency
is this&mdash;when the children come out from the school
they have little use either for the faculties that have been
developed, or for the knowledge that has been acquired.
Their resources have not been brought into demand; their
powers are not roused or strengthened by exercise. Our
common phrases, &#8216;the active duties of life&#8217;; &#8216;the responsibilities
of citizenship&#8217;; &#8216;the stage, the career, of action&#8217;; &#8216;the
obligations to posterity&#8217;;&mdash;would be strange sounding words
in the Prussian ear.... Now, although there is a sleeping
ocean in the bosom of every child that is born into the world,
yet if no freshening, life-giving breeze ever sweeps across its
surface, why should it not repose in dark stagnation forever.&#8221;
The bill of particulars with which the great educator clinches
his indictment of the Prussian system, while it aims to describe
accurately only the then existing condition in Prussia,
might be equally applicable to almost any other absolutist,
paternalistic state. All responsibility for the people&#8217;s welfare
was assumed by the monarch, who in turn was actively
aided by a hierarchy of officials in state and church, in the
central government and the local administrative areas.</p>

<p>Of this officialdom, particularly in its military and civil
aspects, the nobility was not merely the corner stone but the
essential part of the structure. The church, loyal to its traditions,
was much more democratic, men of every class being
found in each of its official grades. The newly developed
educational system gave to the common man another significant
opportunity, since teaching candidates were drawn in
large numbers from the middle and lower classes, and were
given at public expense the training necessary to fit them for
permanent positions in the various types of schools. On the
whole, however, life beyond the school, which among Americans
of that day commonly yielded the major part of education,
was in Prussia far less fruitful. For, the American,
whose formal schooling had been limited, was sure to multiply
its efficacy many times through the intensely original character
of his activities. In these he was apt to employ everything
he had learned, and constantly to learn more for the
sake of applying the new knowledge to challenging situations.</p>

<p>The contrast between the average Prussian&#8217;s life and the
average American&#8217;s life was sharp and decisive. The boy
leaving school at fourteen in Frederick William&#8217;s country
was thrust at once into a routine of severe labor, controlled by
others. Either he might be on a farm, where his duties were
fixed by custom and minutely directed by parent or employer;
or he might be apprenticed to a trade which would give him
seven years under an exacting master. Assuming that he
remained in his native region, his career thenceforth would be
determined with the minimum of personal effort. The
American boy whose schooling stopped at an early age might
go west and start a new farm home in a new environment,
with every incentive toward employing his best powers to
win unusual success; he might go to the city and engage in
some business; attend school to prepare for a profession; or
settle down on the ancestral acres under social and economic
conditions which called for almost continuous readjustments,
and kept his mind on the stretch to bring these about.</p>

<p>The governmental arrangements in America were inherently
educational; in Prussia they were the reverse, save
when, with revolutionary fury, the people rose to seek their
destruction or reform. In Prussia, says Horace Mann, &#8220;the
subject has no officers to choose, no inquiry into the character
or eligibility of candidates to make, no vote to give. He
has no laws to enact or abolish. He has no questions about
peace or war, finance, taxes, tariffs, post office, or internal
improvements to decide or discuss. He is not asked where
a road shall be laid, or how a bridge shall be built, although
in the one case he has to perform the labor and in the other
to supply the materials.... The tax gatherer tells him how
much he is to pay, the ecclesiastical authority plans a church
which he must build; and his spiritual guide, who has been set
over him by another, prepares a creed and a confession of
faith all ready for his signature. He is directed alike how
he must obey his King and worship his God.&#8221;</p>

<p>The schools of Prussia inculcated religion and morality as
sedulously as they taught geography, singing, and writing,
the methods used being highly praised by American pedagogical
experts. This universal insistence on the ethical content
of life could not fail to produce results more or less in
harmony with the aims of great ethical philosophers, like Kant
of Königsberg, a teacher of the learned whose &#8220;categorical
imperative,&#8221; popularized in that epoch, has not yet gone into
the philosophical discard. The average German immigrants
of the 1840&#8217;s knew little of Kant or the Kantian school of
ethics. But of honesty, truthfulness, and fidelity to the
plighted word they knew much, because those were practical
virtues with which in school if not at home all were indoctrinated.
Thrift and industry were additional but fundamental
virtues which were widely diffused. It is hard for an
empty sack to stand upright. The reason why in America
a German&#8217;s note was more often worth face value than that
of some other classes was because the German usually labored
unceasingly and saved what he earned, thus enabling him to
meet his obligation.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>They were not all saints, these Germans, and in the matter
of personal morality the Prussians particularly seem in those
days to have deserved much of the criticism directed against
them.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> However, it is not necessary to regard even the
Prussians as more lax than most other continentals, and their
character is always explainable as a vulgarized aping of the
low if gilded immoralities of court and aristocracy. Matters
of this sort do not lend themselves readily to statistical inquiry.
But it can hardly be doubted that in France, Prussia,
Austria, or any other country of continental Europe the
private morals of the common people were better on the
whole than those of the upper classes. In America, where immigrants
from those countries came into contact with a self-governing
people of simple habits and prevailingly high
ideals of personal conduct, though with numerous individual
divergences from the type, sharp attention was bound to be
directed to this feature in the character of foreigners, and
the Germans attracted their full share of suspicion and disfavor
from the stricter sort of Americans.</p>

<p>Such suspicions were heightened by certain social customs
of the Germans to which Americans reacted adversely. Sunday
amusements were all but universal among them. Travelers
in Germany dwell upon the gaiety observed in the
villages, or in the city parks and the beer gardens, the distinctive
costumes of different localities lending color and interest
to the scenes. Music was cultivated in every German community;
all Germans could sing and a large proportion could
perform on musical instruments. One was &#8220;as certain to see
a violin as a blackboard in every schoolroom.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Wherever
Germans gathered together&mdash;and Sunday, since it was the
weekly holiday, was their day for assembling&mdash;there was singing
and dancing, usually accompanied by the drinking of
beer or wine to stimulate hilarity. This drinking was not
necessarily excessive, because most Germans were moderate
in their appetites for alcohol, some were unable to spend
much, and all were economical (<i>sparsam</i>). The dances differed
from those favored in this country, being mainly &#8220;round
dances,&#8221; and the standards of decorum in the relations of the
sexes were different also. No wonder that, when German
families settled in groups near our own people, Yankee
fathers and mothers often shook their heads doubtfully in
contemplating the influence upon their children of these unfamiliar
social customs.</p>

<p>It is probable that the vigor with which among this resilient
people amusements were carried on had a definite relation
to the intensity, monotony, and sordidness of the labor
from which they were a recoil. At all events, with more
leisure on week days and an opportunity to do his work under
pleasanter conditions, the German readily adapted himself
to a type of relaxation which was less boisterous and more
genteel. His work and his living being what they were, it is
doubtful if anything better in the form of amusements could
have been expected of him. Travelers from England and
America, on their visits to Germany, were impressed with
the wholesomeness of the Sunday picnics, the rambles through
the forests, the frolics on the village greens and in the parks
adjacent to the towns and cities.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>With all his sociability, joviality, and occasional levity,
the German was not devoid of an element of austerity. This
was one secret of his ability to achieve. Whatever the work
might be, he settled himself to its performance with a grim
determination expressive of century-long training. The
mechanic, from his apprentice years, was habituated to long
hours of unremitting but improving toil. The farmer
(<i>bauer</i>) was a traditional daylight-saver and a night-worker
besides, such excessive labor being compulsory under the system
of serfdom, when the peasant&#8217;s time was levied upon to
a very large extent by the lord. The German schools inculcated
similar habits of relentless application to the work in
hand, and even the government bureaus, under rigorous task-masters
like old Friedrich Wilhelm and his son Frederick
the Great, enforced compliance with the ideal of a patient,
steady &#8220;grind&#8221; which not inaptly typified the German in the
eyes of other peoples. The German often performed less
work in the time consumed than an alert Yankee would have
performed in a shorter day; his tools and implements were
generally awkward and inefficacious; even in scholarship he
not infrequently took the long way around to reach his goal&mdash;but
he usually reached it because he had no notion of turning
back or of stopping at a halfway point on his job. Persistent
rather than brilliant, more industrious than inventive, the
German toiled on, content if he always had something to show
for his labor. The contrast, in that generation, between the
German at work and the German at play is the contrast between
a man governed by an intense purpose to accomplish
a given task, whether interesting or not, and the same man
intent on accomplishing nothing with every physical, intellectual,
and emotional evidence of enjoying the process.
Some men carry into their play the morale which governs
them in their work; others import into their work the spirit
of their play. In the case of the mid-nineteenth century German
the two aspects of his existence, work and play, differed
in spirit quite as much as in content.</p>

<p>The Germans had their Puritan sects, like the Moravians
and other pietists, whose attitude was distinctly other-worldly,
to whom play was a sedate if not a solemn activity. Such
people disapproved of dancing and beer drinking Germans
quite as heartily as of profane whiskey drinking and quarrelsome
Americans or Irish. Individuals and colonies of the
pietistic classes passed into the emigrations, and thus Wisconsin&#8217;s
German population contained most of the elements to be
found at the same time in the German states. This illustrates
one difficulty in generalizing about social characteristics;
there are so many exceptions to be noted that the generalization
loses much of its validity.</p>

<p>Craftsmanship was a prevalent accomplishment among
the Germans of the early emigration. Every shipload of
emigrants of which we have a social analysis had a large
proportion of craftsmen, who were either established members
of the city and village industrial class, or else belonged
to the peasantry and had learned a craft in order to improve
their status. Trades were learned exclusively under the apprenticeship
system, the candidate usually living in the
master&#8217;s home and giving service at the master&#8217;s will. When
he reached the journeyman stage he was privileged to find
work for himself, a quest which though usually fruitful in
educational results often proved disappointing from a monetary
point of view. In those cases the journeyman was
peculiarly open to the temptation to emigrate. Arrived in
this country, the chances of finding employment in the line
of his training varied. Sometimes they were excellent, at
other times poor, depending mainly upon the craft represented.
Carpenters were in great demand, as were also
blacksmiths, wheelwrights, millwrights, masons, bricklayers,
plasterers, and in general all representatives of the building
trades and of trades ministering to farmers. Others were in
occasional demand. But, if a dyer, or a slater, or a cabinet
maker, or a silversmith, or a tile maker, or a weaver, or a
wood carver happened to find himself in America without a
market for his peculiar skill, he always had the resource of
taking land and commencing as a farmer. Many craftsmen,
indeed, came with the set purpose of doing that immediately
upon their arrival; others contemplated a farming career
after a period devoted to their specialty. In some or all of
these ways Germans trained as craftsmen came to be widely
distributed over the farming areas of Wisconsin as well as
among the cities, towns, and villages.</p>

<p>The possession of special skill in any line, like the possession
of special scientific knowledge, raises a man in social estimation,
and every trained worker properly regards himself
with satisfaction as being not quite &#8220;as other men are.&#8221; In
addition to the social training which came to him as an incident
of his apprenticeship and journeyman&#8217;s experience, the German
craftsman often was able to challenge the respect and
admiration of his American neighbors by making articles of
cunning workmanship which to them seemed wonderful because
they did not understand the processes involved.
Agriculture being regarded as an unskilled occupation, the
artisan farmer also was very apt to lord it over the peasant
farmer of his own nationality. Craftsmanship, in a word,
established a kind of rank among Germans in this country
because it was a recognized means of personal and social
progress at home.</p>

<p>Statistics are impossible to procure, but the testimony of
men and women familiar with early conditions in Wisconsin
proves that the German population of the state in early days
varied quite as widely in social characteristics as did the
American population, though America had no distinctive
peasant class. Accordingly, although in the beginnings of
American contacts with their Prussian or Westphalian
neighbors these were lumped together indiscriminately as
&#8220;Dutchmen,&#8221; differences soon began to emerge. In the
course of a few years a class of &#8220;fine old Germans&#8221; was recognized
in almost every community to supplement the well-known
type of &#8220;fine old Yankee gentlemen.&#8221; These select
Germans were very apt to be men who had been trained as
craftsmen, or men who had enjoyed the advanced scientific or
literary instruction afforded in the higher schools and the
universities of the homeland. In the cities, especially Milwaukee,
were many Germans who had been prominent in
business lines as well as in the professions.</p>

<p>The question has sometimes arisen why so many of the
second-generation Germans appear inferior in social character
to their immigrant parents. A hint of the reason is
found in what has just been said. Whatever elements of
superiority were shown by the immigrant artisan-farmers or
the highly educated Germans, the social advantages accruing
therefrom were personal, and in a slightly developed
western society could not be handed on to the next generation.
In the cities it frequently was possible for men of high
ideals and fine social status to provide equivalent opportunities
for their children. But not so on frontier farms. There it
was a rare case when an education or training like that
received by the father in the old country could be supplied.
Accordingly, the sons of the most intelligent, dignified, and
worthy German farmer, if they became farmers in succession,
might perhaps turn out mere farmers, with none of the
graces or exceptional social virtues of the parents, and
little except the memory of a parent&#8217;s high respectability to
distinguish them from the farmer sons of the clumsiest
peasant.</p>

<p>However, this is but half the story. If the superior Germans
reared families incapable of remaining on their own
social plane, other types of Germans, who in their own
persons counted for less, frequently had the happiness to see
their children advance to a position perceptibly higher than
their own. Natural gifts, industry, the social opportunities
which yield to the key of economic success availed much.
Sometimes the presence of a good school, a wise and helpful
pastor or some other worthy friend gave the necessary impulse.
The process, in fact, does not differ essentially from
that which, throughout American pioneer history, has enabled
the deserving to press forward and permitted the weak,
indolent, or vicious to fall behind in the social competition.
It is impossible to say how many German families made a
step, or several steps, upward, and how many others slipped
back. The delinquents may perhaps exceed the meritorious
in number, but probably not, and the impression that the
children of German immigrants shame their parents is almost
certainly an illusion which would be likely to disappear if
the facts were fully known.</p>

<p>The social institutions of Wisconsin, based on the earlier
Yankee and southwestern immigrations, were profoundly
influenced by the German immigration of the late forties and
the fifties of last century. Milwaukee, the center of German
influence (the <i>Deutsche Athen</i>), became a city in which
the German language was spoken and read by many English
speaking persons, in order to facilitate communication and
trade with the numerically dominant German element. The
Germans maintained advanced schools for instruction in both
English and German; their parochial schools were conducted
mainly in German; the immigrants themselves felt no compulsion
to learn English, and their children, in many cases,
however well educated, spoke the language of the country
with very imperfect accent.</p>

<p>The universal respect in which the German language was
held, and the extent to which it was affected by others than
Germans, provided an admirable social soil for the development
of German music and the cultivation of German literature.
Hardly had the immigrants established themselves
when, in 1847, they founded at Milwaukee their first singing
society, which was followed three years later by the famous
and far-reaching <i>Musikverein</i>. A German theater followed
promptly, and became a permanent feature of Milwaukee&#8217;s
intellectual life.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The <i>Turnverein</i> fostered in America Father
Jahn&#8217;s conception of athletics, while restaurants and beer
gardens gave an old world, continental atmosphere to public
recreation. Holidays assumed a German aspect. The <i>Christ
Child</i> displaced <i>St. Nicholas</i> not alone in Milwaukee, but in
scores of towns, villages, and hamlets, and innumerable farm
homes scattered over Wisconsin. The joyous German <i>Weinacht</i>
made way easily against the more somber Puritan
Christmas, which, however, had already brightened a good
deal in its progress from the seventeenth century to the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>In general, Germans did not insist with extreme pertinacity
upon the retention of their own social customs, and
wherever people of that nationality were intermingled with a
larger number of Americans, the process by which they assimilated
American habits of living, American social usages,
and even ways of acting, speaking, and thinking was very
rapid. In the schools of a Yankee neighborhood the children
of German settlers, in many cases, could not be distinguished
by their manner of speech from the Yankee children. On
the other hand, in communities made up wholly or mainly of
Germans, the grandchildren continue to have trouble with
the <i>th</i> sound in English words, and manifest other linguistic
peculiarities. And this difference is merely symptomatic.
To this day, it is easy to reconstruct, in case of the average
person of German descent, the atmosphere in which he was
brought up. If he comes from Milwaukee, or from some
rural &#8220;Dutch settlement,&#8221; that fact is usually clear from a
hundred trifling intimations. If he was brought up in a non-German
community (so adaptable is the race), a change of
name from the German <i>Weiss</i> to the English <i>White</i>, or from
<i>Schwartz</i> to <i>Black</i>, would ordinarily suffice to disguise the
fact that he is of German descent at all. Germans thus
brought up are apt to have made their religious affiliations
and their intimate social relationships harmonize with those
of the leading American element of the community, so that
these quite as much as their speech would tend to conceal their
racial origin.</p>

<p>Wisconsin writers have made much of the fact that emigrating
German revolutionists came to this state largely in
1848 and the years following. That fact, significant as
bringing to Wisconsin Carl Schurz, who became the most
noted liberal American statesman and publicist of German
birth, has perhaps been overstressed. At least, it can safely
be said that for every revolutionist disembarked at Milwaukee
or Sheboygan or Manitowoc, probably a full score of
plain, everyday, conventional Germans filtered into the state&#8217;s
population during the same time. The important point about
the revolutionists is not their relative numbers, but their character
and the leadership they helped to supply in the affairs
of the new commonwealth. Newspaper editors who possessed
exceptional literary and scholastic attainments came from
that class; some found their way into the legislature, and
many served the cause of liberal government on the local
plane.</p>

<p>The name of Schurz was one to conjure with, as American
politicians were quick to discover. He figured prominently
in Wisconsin state politics only a few years, but as a
national leader his influence in attaching the Germans to the
causes he advocated was especially strong in this state, which
claimed him as her own. Schurz&#8217;s high character and attainments,
coupled with his political successes in this country,
were a source of pride to thousands of Wisconsin Germans
who shared not at all his revolutionary views. Enough that,
like Goethe, he was a great German, and that he had gained
the respect and confidence of large sections of the American
people. It ministered to the self-respect of the average
German settler to feel that his people had contributed something
of value to the life of the nation and state.</p>

<p>Later arrivals from Germany, and especially from Prussia,
brought with them an intense pride of nationalism and
enthusiasm for German achievement in the wars against
Austria and against France. The difference in attitude between
immigrants of 1880 and those of forty years earlier
was antipodal. Many of the former had served in the victorious
wars and abounded in military incidents and in stories
of Bismarck, of Kaiser Wilhelm I, and Crown Prince
Frederick William (<i>Unser Fritz</i>). These men obviously
belonged to a new generation of Germans, and they have
exerted a powerful influence upon our recent history. But
the Germans who deserve special recognition along with the
Yankees, as founders of the commonwealth and its institutions,
are those of the earlier immigrations from a Fatherland
which as yet was united only in culture, while politically its
states remained dissevered.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Sons of the Pilgrims&#8221; of Milwaukee held in
December, 1850, their customary banquet to celebrate the
historic landing on Plymouth Rock. The occasion was one
which stimulated the flow of oratory and the display of
quaint Yankee humor and sparkling wit. Among the toasts,
some of which embodied genuine wisdom, was the following:
&#8220;Our adopted state. She has gathered her sons from
many lands and given them all a home amid her bounty
and her beauty. May the elements of strength and greatness
peculiar to each be here transplanted and united to form
a perfect commonwealth.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The sentiment was notably generous, voiced as it was
by one out of the many and diverse population elements,
and we now see that it was also prophetic. But the attainment
of the ideal here advanced was not to result from an
effortless, unconscious process. Much history is involved
in the relations of Yankee and Teuton&mdash;to say nothing of
other stocks&mdash;which reveals a general tendency to helpful
coöperation, but presents, on the other hand, episodes
marked by animosity, jealousy, and social estrangement.
If there were social harmonies, there were also discords.</p>

<p>As early as 1850 Milwaukee contained more Germans
than Yankees. Out of an aggregate population of 20,059
the census taker had designated 3880 as natives of the
New England states and New York, while 5958 were born
in Germany. The entire American element (aside from
natives of Wisconsin, who were children of the foreign
born as well as of the American born) amounted to 5113,
while the number of foreigners was 12,036. Of these, more
than 3000 were Irish and about 1300 English. Thus the
German was numerically the dominant social factor in
the city.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in all but numbers the Yankee element
remained, as it had been from the beginning of the town&#8217;s
growth, in a position of acknowledged leadership. There
would be no difficulty in proving that socially, industrially,
and commercially the places of power were occupied by the
&#8220;down-easters,&#8221; while in politics, although their control was
being challenged from one side or another, they were still
far from recognizing a master.</p>

<p>Yankees were the promoters of those far-reaching
improvements, like the various plank roads, and especially
the railroads, which were destined to unite the extensive
new settlements with Milwaukee and thus guarantee the
future greatness of the city. They were largely engaged
in the carrying trade on the Lakes. They controlled the
flour milling business, the leading industry of the city, in
which was concentrated probably more capital than was
invested in all other lines of manufacturing carried on at
that time. They were also prominent in wholesale merchandising
and owned the most pretentious retail stores.</p>

<p>Their general preëminence in the professions was undisputed.
They had most of the lawyers, a large proportion
of the physicians, the editors of English language papers,
the Protestant clergymen, the teachers. Public opinion,
with a reservation to be stated presently, was mainly of
their making, both in the city itself and&mdash;through the agency
of a widely read newspaper press&mdash;in the state at large.
On all questions affecting public education, social morality,
health, and recreation, as well as business or industry, the
American portion of the community was very apt to mass
behind Yankee leadership; and the English speaking
section of the foreign population was not averse to doing
the same, at least under ordinary circumstances. Often,
indeed, such was the prestige of the Yankees, their initiative
was followed unquestioningly by American and foreigner
alike.</p>

<p>But the weight of numbers being with the Germans,
the bulk of whom did not speak or read English&mdash;though
there were numerous exceptions,&mdash;it was natural that
there should have developed a community leadership within
their own group, and such leadership would be determinative
in cases of divergence from American ideas. The presence
of this great body of non-English speaking persons, clothed
with political power and wielding also a goodly share of
economic power, especially as manifested in consumption,
tended in itself to generate a more amiable attitude and
more moderate policies on the part of the dominant class.</p>

<p>For the Germans were a coherent, prosperous, and growing
element in the city. They began coming in 1839, and
during the succeeding decade the annual accretions waxed
gradually larger. After the revolution of 1848 the tide of
emigration, especially from the countries and provinces
along the Rhine, was swollen to unprecedented proportions,
Milwaukee and the whole state profiting largely therefrom.
But, already before 1850 Milwaukee&#8217;s streets, business
places, and homes were so habituated to German speech,
that most visitors unhesitatingly described it as a German
city. &#8220;In the colony of Herman alone,&#8221; wrote Carl de Haas
in 1848, &#8220;among all the United States is the population so
preponderantly German.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> This writer also says, as do
other chroniclers of his race, that not alone the speech of
his country, but also the national habits and customs
prevailed exceedingly in Milwaukee; that the Americans
made many concessions to the Germanism of the environment&mdash;merchants,
for example, learning the language
themselves, or at least keeping clerks in their establishments
who could speak it, in order to attract German trade.</p>

<p>The emigration which began in 1839 as a religious
movement, a congregation of Old Lutherans fleeing the
pressure of the illiberal policy of Prussia&#8217;s king, was continued
thereafter mainly from economic and social motives.
An examination of the census schedules of 1850 for Milwaukee
reveals its general character better than volumes
of reminiscent testimony. The census shows that, among
the 5958 Germans in the city, 1165 (if the count is accurate)
were craftsmen. There were house carpenters, ship carpenters,
smiths, wheelwrights, millwrights, cabinet makers,
masons, plasterers, painters, brickmakers, tailors, shoemakers,
saddlers, watchmakers, coppersmiths, silversmiths
and goldsmiths, barbers, bakers, brewers, cigar makers,
musicians, sailors, and many more. In contrast to the
large number of craftsmen, those employed at common
labor numbered only 461, while the aggregate of those who
may be described as business men was 248. A total of
45 persons fall in the class of professional men. Many, even
of the laborers, possessed some property, thus showing that
they were of a substantial, home-making type. A good
many of the craftsmen owned homes, some of the business
men were possessed of real estate to an appreciable extent,
and there were a very few capitalists whose properties were
valued at from $20,000 to $50,000.</p>

<p>The significance to the city of having among the population
so large a body of thoroughly trained and skilled artisans
cannot readily be overstated. It toned up all building operations
and enabled them to keep pace with the city&#8217;s rapidly
growing needs; it facilitated the establishment and expansion
of industries depending upon a full supply of
skilled labor; it gave the city a fine body of industrious, well
paid residents as homemakers and citizens&mdash;at a time
when American artisans were very prone to seek land
and raise farm produce. American business and industrial
leaders in Milwaukee appreciated the German craftsmen
who contributed largely to the prosperity of the city; and
the same may be said of the common laborers.</p>

<p>The appearance of Germans with capital which sought
investment in lines of business already pursued by Americans
was no doubt less welcome, and to some it may have seemed
like an intrusion. Generally, however, Germans began their
business enterprises on so modest a scale, and built them
up so gradually, that no serious economic dislocations could
have been felt in consequence. In some cases the German
business men merely undertook to meet demands created
by the presence of their own people, which demands were
not fully cared for by existing American enterprise. Perhaps
no better illustration of this tendency can be found than the
local tobacco trade. &#8220;Groceries,&#8221; of course, carried the
&#8220;plug tobacco&#8221; used so widely in those days by Americans
of all classes, while drug stores handled cigars. But smoking
was more nearly universal among European immigrants
than among Americans. Germans accordingly set up
tobacco shops, which usually included a department for
the manufacture of cigars. The investments were all
small, ranging from $50 to $4000, but the payroll was of some
consequence to the city and the output considerable. It
is believed that all firms of tobacconists or cigar manufacturers
listed by the census takers in 1850 were Germans.</p>

<p>Another industry in which Germans were prominent in
1850 was tanning. This they did not monopolize, for
several non-German tanners were operating at the same
time. But G. Pfister and Company, Tanners, had an
investment of $35,000 and, employing thirty-five men,
manufactured an annual product valued at $45,000, while
all other tanneries taken together had an aggregate investment
of less than $7500.</p>

<p>In boot and shoe manufacturing one American firm
was far in the lead.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Yet, on a smaller scale, German firms
were participating in the business actively, while German
craftsmen were an important element in the success of
all shoe manufacturers. A similar statement will hold
true in the department of brickmaking. A large number
of Germans worked in the brickyards as experts, and
several had small plants of their own. But the big brickyard
of the city was not managed by Germans.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> There
was one single rope maker, who was a German, and also one
glove and mitten manufacturer, who was also German.
Both of these industries were small.</p>

<p>There remains the historically important Milwaukee
industry of beer-brewing, popularly supposed to have been
introduced by immigrants from Munich and other centers
of beer manufacture in the fatherland. The census lists
a total of ten establishments designated as breweries. Of
these, seven were owned by Germans and three by non-Germans.
The investments by the latter aggregated
$27,000, those of the former $20,900. But the sum of the
annual products of the German breweries was $41,062,
while the aggregate product of the others was $32,425.
The non-German brewery which had the largest investment
was doing an annual business valued at less than the
investment, while one of the German breweries having only
$3000 invested reported a product valued at $18,000.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>When we consider mercantile lines as distinguished from
the industrial, Germans were prominent in those which
called for moderate investments. They had many small
grocery stores scattered through the city, a number of
meat markets, and of course a goodly proportion of liquor
saloons. There were also several German clothing stores,
confectioneries, and bakeries. That their business men
expected to sell almost exclusively to Germans is indicated
by the fact that for the most part they advertised
only in the German language papers&mdash;the <i>Wisconsin Banner</i>
and the <i>Volksfreund</i>,&mdash;not in the English papers. On the
other hand, the American merchants, as we have already
seen, catered to the German trade by providing German
salesmen,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and they also advertised extensively in the
German papers.</p>

<p>There were German taverns which did a thriving trade;
the restaurants made the sojourner from Berlin feel at home;
and the German beer gardens were the despair of the
pious Yankee mothers of boys. So indispensable did
German musicians become, that when the Sons of the
Pilgrims banqueted, a brass band directed by a German
bandmaster discoursed &#8220;martial as well as festive&#8221; music.</p>

<p>One other form of coöperation between Yankee and
Teuton deserves to be mentioned&mdash;the employment of
German girls in Yankee homes. This custom, testified to
by German writers and indicated unmistakably by the
census, was widespread. Such service was an immediate
resource to the poorer immigrant families, and a boon to
the American families as well. By that means numbers of
future German homemakers came promptly into possession
of the manners and customs of the Yankees, acquired their
speech, and gained some insight into their distinctive
views of life.</p>

<p>The least numerous of the special classes into which we
have analyzed the German population of Milwaukee, in
1850, was the professional class. Yet it is not for that
reason least important, for the little group of forty-five<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
persons contained most of the individuals whose views
swayed public opinion among the 6000 Milwaukee Germans.
Among them were two newspaper editors, each in charge
of a German language paper. There were six lawyers, nine
teachers, and eleven clergymen and preachers. Four of
the preachers are described as German Lutheran, one was
Evangelical, and one Methodist.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Two, Joseph Salzman
and Franz Fusseden, were Catholic priests. One, F. W.
Helfer, was called a &#8220;rationalist preacher.&#8221; Two, John
Mühlhauser and G. Klügel, were merely called preachers.</p>

<p>It is not strange that medicine, among all the professions,
should have had the strongest representation. A physician,
wherever trained, is equipped to practice anywhere, while
a lawyer, clergyman, editor, or teacher is obliged to prepare
for service by first fitting himself into the community he is
to serve. German medical education was far superior to
American at that time, and, in the western states at least,
the supply of trained physicians was below the requirements.
There were communities in Wisconsin where not
one-fourth of the practitioners were graduates of medical
schools or had honestly earned the title of &#8220;doctor.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
This condition made a splendid opportunity for German
physicians, who could hope to win the patronage of Americans
as well as Germans. That the prospect was alluring
to them is shown by the fact that Milwaukee at the census
date in 1850 had seventeen German physicians, some of
them already men of note in the community.</p>

<p>The Yankees and the Germans came into such close
and intimate contacts in Milwaukee, that it is easier to
study their normal attitudes there than in the outlying
portions of the state. On the whole those relations, in the
period terminating with the Civil War, appear to have been
marked by mutual respect, if not active friendship. At all
events, if there were differences causing ill will on one side
or the other, these&mdash;so far as they were the outgrowth of the
social, economic, or commercial interplay of the two groups&mdash;rarely
became serious enough to be reflected in the
public press. The prosperity of the city, providing usually
full employment and adequate returns to all who wanted
to work, made the bond between capitalist and employees
satisfactory, and this solved one important aspect of the
class problem. The absence of any decided public interest
in the immigrant problem as affecting the city&mdash;other than
politically&mdash;is a fact which obtrudes itself upon one who
canvasses the Milwaukee papers, English and German,
during the fourteen years which intervened between the
first constitutional convention and the election of Abraham
Lincoln to the presidency.</p>

<p>Yet, there are not wanting evidences that the two
groups were quite distinct and that the Germans, as a
foreign group, were sensitively class conscious. This is
shown, for example, by the race appeals in their business
advertisements. To call attention to one&#8217;s nationality when
offering services of a personal nature, like those of the
physician, or the dentist, or even the druggist, is reasonable
and correct. But there is no good ground for assuming
that nationality makes a difference to the purchaser of
lime. Why then the advertisement of a <i>Deutsche Kalk Haus</i>
(German lime house), unless there was a feeling that the
German dealer would be favored by German buyers simply
because he was German? This is a typical example which
goes to show the existence of a city within a city, a German
Milwaukee which tended to live its own group life, for which,
as already explained, it possessed, within itself, great
facilities.</p>

<p>Occasionally some relatively minor happening threw
this feeling of separateness into strong relief, as when, in
1850, a German scholar published in the Milwaukee papers
of his language the story of his relations with the chancellor
and board of regents of the University. He thought they
had promised him a chair, but afterwards they made it
plain that no contract had been closed with him. He may
or may not have had cause of complaint. But what he
professed to do was to lay the whole matter before the
Germans of Wisconsin, in order that they might know how
the board of regents &#8220;flouts the wishes of the German
citizens,&#8221; how it keeps its promises &#8220;to Germans,&#8221; and
how little it regards the rules of ordinary courtesy &#8220;in
dealing with Germans.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> No doubt the design was to
bring political pressure to bear on the regents, but the
device would not have been resorted to had not the recognized
racial unity among the Germans rendered that a hopeful
plan.</p>

<p>In a society like the present Milwaukee, where inter-racial
marriages are a daily occurrence, and one is rarely
conscious of race in cases of that kind, the condition of
seventy years ago seems almost incomprehensible. For, a
close scrutiny of the entire census record for Milwaukee
in 1850 reveals that marriages between Germans and Americans
of all derivations at that time were excessively rare.
The aggregate number of such unions was twelve. But of
marriages between Yankees and Germans I can provisionally
identify only six, as follows: Margaret, twenty-six years
of age, born in Germany, was the wife of John H. Butler, a
livery-stable keeper, born in New York. Hiram Brooks,
twenty-seven, born in New York, was married to Mary,
twenty-three, born in Hesse Darmstadt. James Ridgeway,
thirty, a cooper, native of New York, was married to Mary,
born in Prussia. Abram Davis, twenty-five, a cooper, born
in New York, was married to C&mdash;, twenty-three, native of
Bavaria. Joseph Stadter, thirty-three, physician, rated
at $2000, who was born in Bavaria, was married to Sarah
Ann, nineteen, born in New York (but a female who was a
member of the family, and may have been this woman&#8217;s
mother, bore a German name). Finally, William Stamm,
thirty-two, painter, native of Bremen, was married to
Lucy, twenty-eight, a native of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>It is not possible to determine how many of the American
born persons represented in the six cases may have belonged
to German families, but doubtless some did. At all events,
we can assert that in Milwaukee at that time, with its nearly
6000 Germans and nearly 4000 Yankees, not more than six
cases can be found of marriages between them. No commentary
is needed to establish the fact of the virtual
segregation of the two great population groups.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> If Chevalier,
the French philosopher, was right in his conviction
that &#8220;the Yankee is not a man of promiscuous society,&#8221;
it is equally true that the German at that time was excessively
clannish. His clannishness was due, no doubt, to
natural and inevitable causes, but the fact needs to be recognized
by the student of history.</p>

<p>This disposition on the part of Germans to &#8220;hang
together&#8221; was promptly discovered by American politicians
and exploited for partisan and personal ends. The outstanding
fact of the political history of the period under
review is the attachment of the immigrant Germans to the
Democratic party. That relation was all but absolute
and universal during the 1840&#8217;s, though a gradual change
took place in the last half of the next decade. There was
nothing mysterious about it. Germans found the country,
on their arrival, living under a Democratic administration,
to which they looked for favors and usually not in vain. The
Democratic party was liberal in the bestowal of lands; it
contended manfully against the principle of monopoly,
especially in banking and other corporate activities; and
it emphasized the doctrine of the equality of all men. The
Germans, like the Irish and, in fact, all immigrants, were
strongly attracted by the principles professed in Democratic
platforms. The very word &#8220;democracy,&#8221; had its winning
appeal. &#8220;Democracy,&#8221; wrote the editor of the <i>Banner</i> in
1850, &#8220;is a glorious word. There are few other words, in
any language, which can be compared to it. To the poor
man it is peculiarly precious since he is aware that he owes
to it his escape from the serfdom in which his oppressors
held him, and can now look up into heaven and thank his
God that he has ceased to be a serf. Democracy knows
no distinctions between man and man. She sets all upon
the broad foundation of equality.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The enormous prestige gained by the Democratic party
under Jackson&#8217;s leadership easily floated the administrations
of Van Buren and Polk. But, as an influence toward captivating
the foreign element in Wisconsin, no other Democratic
principle had quite the efficacy of the liberal suffrage
provision which the party in power adopted at the beginning
of our history as a state.</p>

<p>In Michigan the makers of the state constitution had
granted the voting privilege to all aliens who were <i>bona
fide</i> residents and who had declared their intention to become
citizens. That clause in her organic law drew the criticism
of Whig members of Congress, but she was admitted to the
union in spite of their opposition, and thus was established
the principle that men might be voters without being
citizens. When, in 1846, the territorial legislature of
Wisconsin provided by law for the holding of a constitutional
convention, a similar proviso was made to govern the election
of delegates to the convention.</p>

<p>In Milwaukee County the Democrats nominated eight
candidates for delegates. Dr. Franz Huebschmann was the
sole German named. The <i>Wisconsin Banner</i>, while remarking
that Germans constituting one-third of the population
were to have but a single delegate, urged Germans to vote
as one man for him. He was needed, said the editor,
especially to contend for equality in the voting privilege, for
which he had striven manfully during the past three years.
In the neighbor county of Washington, Germans were
urged to support two Irish candidates who favored equality
of the voting privilege and whom the Whigs (so it was
asserted) were trying to defeat by the same wiles they
employed against Huebschmann. The moral of the <i>Banner</i>
editorials was: &#8220;Don&#8217;t trust the Whigs. They have always
opposed the rights of the foreign born.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> In preparation
for the vote on delegates, Milwaukee Germans who had not
declared their intention were given every direction for
completing that formality, and the indications are that a
large number of voters were newly made for the occasion.</p>

<p>Dr. Huebschmann, in the first convention, was a powerful
advocate of equality, giving as the chief ground in favor
of the principle that it would tend to bring Americans and
foreigners into more harmonious relations with one another.
&#8220;The more distinctions you make between them politically,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;the more you delay this great end [amalgamation],
which is so essential to the future welfare of this
state. And, in fact, I regard only one measure equally
important as the political equality which I ask for, and that
is a good common school system.... Political equality
and good schools will make the people of Wisconsin an enlightened
and happy people. They will make them one
people.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>On the educational question Huebschmann found the
Yankee majority of the convention eager to welcome his
coöperation. On the subject of suffrage their unity was less
complete. While party lines were not strictly drawn, the
chief contenders for equality were leading Democrats and
the chief opponents leading Whigs. But both conventions
adopted the principle, the first not quite frankly, and
with the admission of Wisconsin into the union all foreign
born persons who had resided in the state one year prior
to any election had the right to vote, provided they had
declared their intention to become citizens of the United
States.</p>

<p>The adoption of such a liberal suffrage provision in the
teeth of the nativist movement which had affected all parts
of the country more or less, was considered a great triumph
of Democratic principles. And there is no doubt about the
gratitude of adoptive citizens to the party which secured
them the boon. To the Germans it seemed thenceforward
a simple question of loyalty to support the Democratic
party, through thick and thin, through good report and evil
report. Inasmuch as the Democratic party also supported
the Germans&#8217; views on the subject of temperance (prohibition),
soon to become a burning issue,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and in their contest
with the more serious manifestations of Know-Nothingism,
which in this state reached its climax somewhat later, one
almost wonders how any of the Germans were able to detach
themselves from that party, despite its failure to represent
them on the slavery and free-soil issues.</p>

<p>The temperance movement and nativism were the chief
grounds of political contention between Germans and
Yankees during this period. The first of these broke, in
1853-55, on the rock of German&mdash;which meant Democratic&mdash;opposition.
For, although a referendum vote had gone
in favor of the enactment of a &#8220;Maine Law,&#8221; the Democratic
legislature chosen at the same time refused to accept
the result as mandatory, and did not pass the law. And
when the first Republican legislature did pass such a law, in
the early months of the year 1855, Barstow, the Democratic
governor, vetoed the bill. Never thereafter did the temperance
issue become as acute as it had been during the seven
years immediately following statehood, but it is not strange
that their record on that question was one of the standing
arguments against Republicanism among the German
voters.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The Know-Nothing issue, which was supposed to be dying
out at the time of the Wisconsin constitutional conventions,
1846-1848, revived after the Mexican War, figured prominently
in the defeat of General Scott in 1852, and in this
state as well as in some other states rose to dramatic and
even tragic interest in 1855. Thereafter it declined, to pass
away for the time being with the election of Lincoln and the
engulfing of the nation in war.</p>

<p>But the Know-Nothingism of 1855 was regarded by the
Democratic party as sinister because, as that party professed
to believe, it had got itself incorporated as an important if
not controlling element in the new Republican party. This
the Republican leaders and organs denied with vigor, but
it is true that the general council of the <i>American</i> party in
this state urged the support of the Republican candidates
and professed to have contributed 20,000 votes toward the
election of Bashford. The Republicans had no objection to
Know-Nothing votes, but they feared that the endorsement
of their ticket by the Know-Nothings would cost them
more foreign born votes than it would gain them nativists.
It was tactically wise for the Democrats, and especially the
German Democratic press, to keep the &#8220;Republican-Know-Nothing&#8221;
idea before their people&mdash;and they made the best
use of the opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Temperance,&#8221; after all, was regarded by the Germans as
merely a manifestation of Puritan fanaticism, which must
be opposed in the interest of personal liberty. Much as
they disliked it, their opposition does not seem to have
developed excessive bitterness against the believers in or
practicers of temperance. But nativism, which demanded
that the suffrage be limited to citizens; that naturalization be
made more difficult; that in some departments, as in the
army, natives be favored to the exclusion of the foreign
born, this they felt to be a deliberate and vicious attack
upon the rights of the foreign born as a class. The advocacy
of these principles involved much discussion of the unfitness
of foreigners, their ignorance, their sordidness, their &#8220;un-American&#8221;
habits and customs, in one important respect
their &#8220;anti-American&#8221; religion.</p>

<p>All of this inevitably roused a bitter, fighting resentment
on the part of all foreigners, as it did among radical natives
also, and it is well known that many parts of the country
suffered in consequence from riots and other manifestations
of a class war. In Wisconsin there was less overt hostility
than in some states where the foreign elements were not so
powerful.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The Know-Nothing party as such functioned
seriously only in the one year 1855, and its propaganda
was relatively mild-mannered.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Its chief objects of
attack were the foreign born Catholics, which class included
a majority of the Irish but only a fraction of the Germans,
most of whom&mdash;probably&mdash;were either Lutheran or Reformed,
with an appreciable number of non-churchmen
or &#8220;free-thinkers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Nevertheless, nativism, as entangled
in the political psychology of this eventful year, had its full
share in producing a tragedy in this state also.</p>

<p>It came in the form of a lynching, carried out with hideous
barbarism by a body of the ruder Germans of Washington
County, in August, 1855. It seems that a sickly, weak
witted boy of nineteen, named George DeBar&mdash;a native of
New York State&mdash;felt himself aggrieved by a German farmer
and proposed to administer a beating. This he partly
accomplished, at the farmer&#8217;s home, but his victim fled
into the field, where he found a hiding place. Meantime,
DeBar ran amuck, and meeting the man&#8217;s wife stabbed her
severely but not fatally. He next pursued a fifteen-year-old
boy, Paul Winderling, who was living with the farmer,
attacked him with his pocketknife, and killed him. He
then burned the farmer&#8217;s cabin. DeBar afterwards solemnly
assured his attorneys that the only part of the transaction he
could remember was striking the farmer himself with a stone
knotted in his handkerchief. The belief was widespread that
he became unbalanced mentally at this point, which theory
is really the simplest explanation of his horrible crime, committed
without assignable motive.</p>

<p>Immediately on DeBar&#8217;s arrest a plan was hatched to
storm the jail, take him out, and hang him. The death
penalty had been abolished at the instance, as many felt,
of the Yankee sentimentalists, and the ignorance of some
suggested that, since hanging was only justice in a case like
this, and the state refused to execute a criminal, the people
themselves had a right to take the matter into their own
hands. Unfortunately, a similar case had happened two
weeks earlier at Janesville, in which the avenging crowd was
made up of Americans.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> It was suggested by some that
DeBar was himself a Know-Nothing, or at least trained with
the Know-Nothing element, and there were dire whispers
about the trial judge, Charles H. Larrabee. Doubtless
these rumors were altogether wild. The nineteen-year-old
DeBar, practically <i>non compos mentis</i>, was of no possible
political consequence, while Judge Larrabee at the time was
as sound a Democrat as could be found.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> But passions
once fully aroused hurl reason from its throne, and so it was
in this case. The rowdies gathered at a drinking place in
West Bend, and decided on a lynching.</p>

<p>Judge Larrabee convened a special session of court,
impaneled a grand jury, and having summoned two companies
of militia&mdash;the Union Guards of Ozaukee County, a
German company, and the Washington Guards, another
German company, of Milwaukee&mdash;to come up for the protection
of the prisoner, had him conveyed to the courthouse
and examined. The grand jury brought in a true bill,
charging murder in the first degree. To this the prisoner, on
the advice of his attorneys, pleaded &#8220;not guilty.&#8221; The
multitude which had been permitted to press into the court
room, despite the judge&#8217;s instruction to the militia to limit
the number to the seating capacity of the room, fairly raged
when they found a trial would be required, and before
the prisoner took many steps in the direction of the jail,
they seized him and made way with him.</p>

<p>The severest censure was leveled against the militia
companies and their leaders. All the American writers
whose statements appear in the <i>Sentinel</i> charge that these
companies fraternized with the lynching party, and practically
assert that they had an understanding by which the
prisoner was to be given up to them. The captain of the
Milwaukee company, who was a veteran of the Mexican
War&mdash;though a German immigrant&mdash;insisted with vigor
that his company did all it could to prevent the lynching.
He did not speak for the Union Guards of Ozaukee. All
witnesses agree that one of the Union Guard officers,
Lieutenant Beger, performed his duty manfully and heroically,
but the weight of the testimony condemns the companies
as organizations, and especially their captains. It
would seem that two companies of militia, if well led, ought
to have been able with the butts of their guns to hold off a
rabble of three hundred men, and no witness puts the number
higher than that, while some declare the rush was
made by not more than thirty-five men.</p>

<p>In the Milwaukee captain&#8217;s statement, as in the statements
of other German apologists for the militia, we come at
once upon the political note. They could not expect the
&#8220;Know-Nothing American writers&#8221; to tell the truth about
the tragedy. In other words, they found in the politics of
the time an opportunity to charge prejudice against Americans,
and by that means to dodge the real issue. Two German
writers of West Bend, one of them the undersheriff,
bitterly denounced both the militia companies and the
lynchers, and both more than hint that the passions which
led to the lynching were partly religious. Here, undoubtedly,
we come upon one of the signs of division among the
Germans themselves. It is possible that these two Germans
were politically opposed to the main body of their fellow-countrymen,
for by this time a light minority had already
been attracted away from the Democratic party. However,
we do not know that this was true, and merely call attention
to the several psychological attitudes which, from the
testimony, we know the case disclosed.</p>

<p>Of greatest interest is the attitude of English and German
language papers of Democratic and Republican proclivities.
The <i>Sentinel</i> continued to admit contributions on the West
Bend tragedy for approximately two weeks. It also published
the results of an investigation made on the ground by
one of its staff, and a petition to the governor, said to have
been signed by 186 residents of Washington County, who
asked for the disbandment of the two accused companies
and the withdrawal of their officers&#8217; commissions. But the
<i>Sentinel</i> does not appear to have tried by means of the
incident to influence the political situation which was about
to become superheated. At all events, what it published
would all have been legitimate as news. On the other hand,
the <i>Banner und Volksfreund</i>,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> while condemning the
lynching, made no demand for the punishment of the
lynchers. It tried to exculpate the militia companies
(accepting the Milwaukee captain&#8217;s testimony as against
all other evidence), and deliberately charged that the
<i>Sentinel</i>, in publishing the above-mentioned petition, was
playing for political advantage. This charge was absurd
on its face, for the success of the new Republican movement
which the <i>Sentinel</i> had espoused depended on its ability to
detach Germans from the Democratic party, which assuredly
could not be done by playing into the hands of the
Know-Nothings, and the <i>Sentinel</i> did not hesitate to declare
the Know-Nothing support a handicap to the party.</p>

<p>Both American and German testimony discloses the existence
in Washington County of a strong German party of
law and order. They deplored the lynching and urged the
apprehension and trial of the ringleaders. They realized
that the crime would put a stigma upon their race as well
as upon the county and the state. But, as a matter of fact,
although some of the lynchers were identified in the verdict
of the coroner&#8217;s jury, it must be recorded that no earnest
effort was made to punish them.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Nor was any step of an
official character taken (so far as I have been able to find)
to determine the guilt or innocence of the militia companies
and their officers. In fact, the Democratic press of the
state, evidently fearful of sacrificing some German Democratic
votes, which that year were all needed, deliberately
tried to darken council by confounding this case in principle
not only with the Mayberry case, which it resembled, but
also with another of an entirely different nature, to which
we must give passing attention.</p>

<p>In the previous year, 1854, occurred at Milwaukee the
famous Glover rescue. Glover was a runaway slave who
had been apprehended by his self-styled owner, brutally
man-handled, and confined in the Milwaukee County
jail for safekeeping. Sherman M. Booth, editor of the
<i>Daily Free Democrat</i>, one of the founders of the Republican
party, a vigorous free-soil and antislavery partisan, and
the man in the state who was perhaps most feared and hated
by the Democracy, had argued hotly for the protection of
Glover&#8217;s rights against the man claiming him under the
&#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; compromise law of 1850. Booth called
a public meeting at the courthouse for the purpose, as he
claimed, of concerting measures for helping Glover without
the use of force. But the upshot was a rescue party which
battered down the door of the jail, took Glover out, and by
various shifts and transfers on the underground railway,
carried him to Canada and freedom. Booth was then made
to suffer for all that had been done; he was tried in the
federal court, convicted, fined, and given a jail sentence.</p>

<p>We cannot go into the details of the Booth case, a
<i>cause célèbre</i> in ante-Civil War political history. But the
Democratic papers, after the DeBar lynching, ostentatiously
bemoaned the fact that due to recent events &#8220;neither
national nor state laws&#8221; could hereafter be enforced in
Wisconsin. The beginning of the trouble was the setting
at naught of the national law for the rendition of slaves, in
which the arch Republican Booth was ringleader. The
Mayberry lynching and the DeBar lynching followed in
natural sequence. These editors did not choose to analyze
the difference between the Glover case and the others&mdash;the
fact that the one was a rescue performed at their own
risk by philanthropic men, the others brutal killings committed
by men crazed with the lust of blood vengeance. In
other words, the Democratic press, including those papers
printed in the German language, attempted the impossible
feat of arranging in the same straight line the &#8220;higher law&#8221;
and the lower law.</p>

<p>Of course, the Republican press retorted handsomely,
and probably with considerable political effect, that if the
apologists for mob law in Kansas were &#8220;in favor of the execution
of the fugitive slave act in Wisconsin&#8221; they would
like their avowal to that effect.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> It is well known that
during the 1855 campaign, as in the previous year, a good
many Germans were converted from their old-time Democratic
allegiance.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But both parties were too intent on their
immediate political objects to risk pressing for an investigation
of the West Bend tragedy, which might have alienated
a large section of the German vote in three German counties.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that politics was responsible for the
severity of the onslaught upon the militia companies, since
the nativist propaganda for an exclusively American
militia would be quick to seize upon such an opportunity,
and it is not to be supposed that the politics of the case
was all on one side. Yet, unless the governor was in possession
of facts which were withheld from the public, the
least that could be said against the companies is that they
exhibited criminal inefficiency. From this distance, it looks
as if politics affected the Republican attitude as well as
the Democratic; as if crime was condoned in the interest of
party success, since one party was intent on holding its
former German adherents and the other was determined
to take as many of them as possible into the opposition
camp.</p>

<p>Whether or not the incident leaves the stain of blood on
the path of Wisconsin politics, it marks the nearest approach
to a race war between Germans and Americans
which this general period affords. And by Americans we
practically mean Yankees. For it was a truth which the
German press sensed instinctively, that the Republican
party&mdash;made up of &#8220;shreds and patches,&#8221; as was said,&mdash;embracing
prohibitionists, abolitionists, free-soilers, nativists,
and Whigs, was dominated by the &#8220;Puritan&#8221; element.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
A glance at the history of its origin in Wisconsin will at
least convince the reader of its Yankee paternity.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>However, the Republican party changed radically in
character during the next few years, and as the German
population came to be distributed between it and the Democratic
party, a healthier social tone was the result. The
political campaign of 1856, when Frémont was candidate
for the presidency, was conducted with such enthusiasm
by Wisconsin Republicans, as to make serious inroads on
the Democratic German vote. A number of prominent
German leaders took the stump for Frémont, speaking in
the German language to German audiences with telling
effect. Thereafter, in successive state campaigns and in
the presidential canvass of 1860, the Germans of Wisconsin
were electrified by the compelling oratory of their greatest
campaigner, Carl Schurz, to whom the success of the
Lincoln ticket, both in Wisconsin and other western states
harboring many Germans, was largely due. Such participation
was doing much to justify the prophecy of Dr.
Huebschmann&mdash;that political equality would help to make
the people of Wisconsin &#8220;one people.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Joseph Schafer</span></p></div>


<p>The light which local inquiry can shed upon general
history is well illustrated from a variety of viewpoints in the
story of the Wisconsin village which is the subject of this
sketch.</p>

<p>Muscoda as a present-day railway station is inconspicuously
located on the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul
line, Prairie du Chien division, at the distance of fifty-six
miles almost due west from Madison, one hundred and
fifty-two from Milwaukee; it is forty-two miles east from
Prairie du Chien. The village was begun at the river bank
on the south side of Wisconsin River, in section 1, township
8 north, range 1 west of the fourth principal meridian. It
stretches south from the river toward the flanking hills
about three-fourths of a mile, the main portion now clustering
about the depot, whereas the &#8220;Old Town&#8221; lay farther
north and hugged the river bank.</p>

<p>The ground on which Muscoda stands is a portion of the
sandy plain, the outwash of the erosion process by which the
Wisconsin and its larger tributaries worked their way
through the sandstone stratum. The upper courses of these
tributaries and the smaller streams which feed them have
laid down flood bottoms of rich alluvium. Often, too, the
bench land of their valleys is a fertile limestone soil intermingled
with clayey patches and occasional streaks of sand.
These are all characteristics of the &#8220;Driftless Area,&#8221; as the
geologists have named this region, because the various
primordial movements of glacial ice, so influential in modifying
the topography elsewhere, passed around instead of
over it, leaving no &#8220;drift&#8221; upon it. The terrain is just what
the eroding waters in the course of countless ages made it&mdash;a
system of regular valleys perfectly drained and bounded
by symmetrically sculptured hills or bluffs, which exhibit
a level sky line and decrease in altitude steadily till at the
heads of the streams they merge in the great plateau or
&#8220;prairie&#8221; of southern Wisconsin. The valleys make natural
and not ill-graded highways from the prairie to the Wisconsin
River, while the ranges of bluffs separating them appear
like promontories running out fingerwise from the main
plateau and terminating either where two smaller streams
converge or at the edge of the lower plain laid down by the
Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The principal stream entering the Wisconsin from the
south, in the neighborhood of Muscoda, is Blue River&mdash;the
&#8220;Riviere Bleu&#8221; of the French traders. It has several head
streams rising in township 6-1 E, and a large affluent named
the Fennimore rising in 6-1 W, the Six Mile Creek, rising in
7-1 E and Sandy Branch which heads in 8-1 E. There
are also several small branches entering the Fennimore from
7-2 W. In its lower course the Blue River swerves to the
west, entering the Wisconsin near Blue River Station, in
Township 8-2 W, but its rich upper valleys and those of its
tributaries have always been mainly within the trade area of
Muscoda. North of the Wisconsin the valleys most intimately
associated with Muscoda are Indian Creek, Eagle
Creek, and Knapp&#8217;s Creek in Richland County. The
&#8220;Sand Prairie,&#8221; by which name the sandy plain along the
Wisconsin on the south side has long been known, and a
narrow tract of shelving land between the river and the hills
on the north are also within the Muscoda area.</p>

<p>Since the bluffs are mostly rough land, with only limited
areas on their summits where the soil is deep, free from
stones, and sufficiently even for cultivation, and the sand
prairie comparatively infertile, Muscoda as a trade center
suffers from the low average productivity of her territory.
Still, from pioneer days the long valleys beyond the sand
prairie have yielded abundant harvests; the roads through
them from the high prairie to the south opened to Muscoda&#8217;s
merchants for some years a great trade in livestock and grain
beyond her legitimate boundaries; while the cross ranges
which run out from the high prairie northward approximately
fifteen miles forced the only rival railway,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> when it came,
back upon the great ridge, leaving the north trending valleys
still as a whole tributary to Muscoda.</p>


<h3>THE BACKGROUND</h3>

<p>According to Father Verwyst, a distinguished authority,
the name Muscoda is a corruption of the Chippewa word
&#8220;Mashkodeng&#8221; which means &#8220;prairie.&#8221; A similar corruption
occurs in the name &#8220;Muscatine,&#8221; a town in Iowa, and
there was a tribe of Indians on the Upper Fox River called
Mascouten (prairie Indians).</p>

<p>The earlier name of the place was English Prairie, and
while it is clear that geography suggested &#8220;Prairie&#8221; (or
Savannah), there are various traditions to explain the association
of the word &#8220;English&#8221; with it. One is that some
English families were settled there as early as 1812 and that
they were massacred by the Indians. Another, that the place
was so named from the fact that Colonel McKay, who
descended the river in 1814 with a regiment of British
troops to capture Prairie du Chien, encamped at this place
which thereafter was called English Prairie.</p>

<p>A more hopeful clue to the origin of the name occurs in
the journal of Willard Keyes, a young New Englander who
passed down the river with a party in 1817. He writes,
under date of August 29, 1817: &#8220;pass a place called &#8216;English
meadow&#8217; from an English trader and his son, said to have
been murdered there by the savages, 20 Leagues to Prairie
du Chien.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Now, the fact of &#8220;an English trader and his
son&#8221; being murdered at some point on the Wisconsin River
between the Portage and Prairie du Chien is well established.
In the journal of Lieut. James Gorrell, the first English
commandant at Green Bay after the ejection of the French,
we read, under date of June 14, 1763: &#8220;The traders came
down from the Sack [Sauk] country, and confirmed the
news of Landsing and his son being killed by the French.&#8221;
When all the Sauk and Foxes had arrived at Green Bay a
few days later they told Gorrell that their people were all in
tears &#8220;for the loss of two English traders who were killed
by the French in their lands, and begged leave ... to
cut them [the French] in pieces.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>In the following summer, 1764, Garrit Roseboom testified,
that &#8220;about the latter end of April, 1763, he was going
from the Bay [Green Bay] to the Soaks [Sauk] to look for
his Partner Abrah[a]m Lancing who had been up there,
being told that he was killed, that on his way he met some
Indians coming down with some Packs [of furs], which he
knew to be his, and which they said he could have for paying
the carriage. That both the French and Indians told him,
Mr. Lancing and his son were killed by two Frenchmen&#8221;
who were servants of Mr. Lansing and who afterwards
escaped to the Illinois Indians.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>When we reflect how persistent is the memory of great
tragedies and recall that some of the French traders and
voyageurs who were on the river when the murder took
place remained there for many years and handed down the
traditions of the river to their successors, it is not hard to
believe that it was the story of Abraham Lansing and his
son, slightly altered, which Willard Keyes heard from the
rivermen as his boat drifted along the &#8220;English meadow&#8221; in
1817. The French traders in whose company he was would
not be likely to ascribe the murder to their own people so
long as there were &#8220;savages&#8221; who might just as well serve
as scapegoats. We may consider it almost certain, then,
that the place came to be called English Prairie from the
gruesome crime of 1763, which had occurred almost three-quarters
of a century before the postoffice of that name was
established, and more than half a century prior to the voyage
of Willard Keyes. Jonathan Carver, who visited a village
of the Fox Indians at that place in 1766, does not use the
name; but neither does he mention the story of the murder
which occurred only three years before.</p>

<p>No definite information about the fur trade at English
Prairie, aside from the record in Lansing&#8217;s case, has come
down to us. Tradition has it that Laurent Rolette, brother
of the famous Prairie du Chien trader, Joseph Rolette,
traded there for some years, going later to the Portage. It
appears also that some time before the arrival of white settlers
a trader named Armstrong operated in that neighborhood.
But no details have been preserved and we can only
infer from the fact that Indians were still numerous when
settlers came that the trade at English Prairie in earlier
times was probably important.</p>

<p>It was the Black Hawk War and the treaties following it
that produced the revolutionary change in the life of the
natives in this region. From that time forward Indians
could live south of the river only on sufferance, though they
were permitted to roam the forests to the northward for
about a quarter of a century longer. During the Black
Hawk War a detachment of Colonel Henry Dodge&#8217;s
Mounted Volunteers went to English Prairie, another detachment
going at the same time to Prairie du Chien.
Between them these two bodies of troops scoured both sides
of the Wisconsin from the mouth to the Portage, dislodging
all natives. English Prairie was also the camping ground for
a military company composed of friendly Indians recruited
at Green Bay and led to Prairie du Chien by Samuel C.
Stambaugh in July, 1832. The route of march was from
Green Bay to the Portage, thence to Sugar Creek (near
Blue Mounds), thence to Fort Dodge (Dodgeville), thence
to English Prairie, thence to Prairie du Chien &#8220;with one
other camping between.&#8221;</p>


<h3>RELATION TO THE LEAD MINES</h3>

<p>History repeats itself in making the Indian War of
1832 the impulse to a great new expansion movement
among American pioneers. Just as the Pequod War of
1638 by familiarizing the coast settlers of Massachusetts
with the rich lands of the interior enticed them westward,
and as the Seven Years&#8217; War destroyed the last obstacle
to western and northern expansion in New England, so in a
very real sense this war made the beginnings of the agricultural
settlement in Wisconsin. Immediately after the Black
Hawk War the survey of the lands in southern Wisconsin
began. In the four years, 1832 to 1836, the entire region
from the Illinois line north to the Wisconsin, the Fox, and
Green Bay, and from the Mississippi to Lake Michigan,
was checked off into townships and sections. Hardy, resourceful
government surveyors, with their crews (usually
two chainmen and one axman) traversed every square mile,
whether prairie, forest, valley, or bluff. In 1834 a land
office was opened at Mineral Point for the sale of lands in
the western portion of Michigan Territory (as it was then).</p>

<p>The ranges of townships numbered 1 W and 1 E, of
which the townships numbered eight (Muscoda and
Pulaski) bounded by the Wisconsin, were for some years the
northernmost, were surveyed by Sylvester Sibley in 1833.
The next year those lands were offered for sale and some
tracts along the river were actually sold to private individuals.
Among the purchasers were Thomas Jefferson Parrish
and Charles Bracken, who were well-known lead miners
and smelters living farther south. Others among the early
land owners of Township 8-1 W have been identified as
mining men.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b009.jpg" alt="THE LEAD REGION" /></div>

<p class="caption">THE LEAD REGION<br />

<small>After Owens&#8217; Geological Chart, 1839; drawn by Mary Stuart Foster</small></p>

<p>The lead mines, while known and worked by Indians and
a few traders for many years, received the first large body
of emigrants in 1828, when several thousand came scattering
out widely over the territory which now constitutes Grant,
Iowa, and Lafayette counties in Wisconsin, together with
adjacent parts of Iowa. These were the lead miners who
under Dodge and Hamilton fought the Black Hawk War.
It was these hardy pioneers who as troopers patrolled the
Wisconsin River and who finally delivered the coup de
grace to Black Hawk&#8217;s band far to the north on the banks of
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Many of the lead miners were shrewd business men
always on the lookout for good financial prospects. With
the knowledge of new regions gained during the war, either
from personal observation or from reliable report, with the
sense of a new era opening to settlement and expansion in
the region dependent for transportation facilities on the
Mississippi and Wisconsin rivers, it is not strange that some
of them should have been interested in river points lying
as far outside the mineral belt proper as did English Prairie.</p>


<h3>A RIVER PORT</h3>

<p>For it is clear that it was water and not lead that the
pioneers of Muscoda sought. Surveyors and prospectors
had found no hopeful signs of mineral north of townships
6-1 W and 7-1 E. A few years later (1839) Dr. David Dale
Owen, the geologist, made his famous survey of the lead
region and excluded from it everything north of the heads
of Blue River in townships 6 and 7-1 E. When the lands
in township 8-1 W were offered for sale in November, 1834,
it was precisely the river front lots and subdivisions which
were taken first. Parrish entered fractional lots 2 and 3
of section 1; Frederick Bronson the northeast fraction of
the southeast quarter of section 1; Isaac Bronson the south
half of the southeast fractional quarter; Garrit V. Denniston
the southeast half of the fractional southwest quarter; and
Denniston and Charles Bracken fraction No. 4 of fractional
section 1. Other water front tracts in section 2 were bought
by Denniston at this time; between 1836 and 1841 other
tracts in the same sections were bought by others. All of
these lands were obviously deemed favorable locations for a
prospective town dependent on river transportation.</p>

<p>The way in which the village was begun, by the erection
of a smelting furnace, is rather startling, in view of the
absence of lead in the region adjacent. The motives which
induced Colonel William S. Hamilton of Wiota to build a
furnace at English Prairie can only be conjectured.</p>

<p>Colonel Hamilton was the son of the great Alexander
Hamilton, Washington&#8217;s Secretary of the Treasury. As a
lad of seventeen in 1814 he entered West Point but resigned
in 1817 to accept a commission as deputy surveyor-general
under Col. William Rector, surveyor-general for Illinois,
Missouri, and Arkansas. From that time young Hamilton
was almost continuously in the West, though he made one
trip east, on horseback, to see his mother. He was in
Wisconsin as early as 1825 and in 1827 began his career as a
lead miner and smelter in what is now Lafayette County
at Wiota or Hamilton&#8217;s Diggings. He took part in the
Indian troubles of 1827, and also in the Black Hawk War.</p>

<p>It is not known with certainty when Hamilton established
his furnace at English Prairie. Tradition says it was
in the year 1835. If the furnace was operating then, it is
strange that so careful an observer as Featherstonhaugh,
who dropped down the Wisconsin in August, 1835 and
stopped at English Prairie to draw a sketch of its landscape,
should have failed to note that fact.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> We are probably
justified in asserting that the furnace was not there at that
time. But we know it was there in 1837, for Captain
Frederick Marryat, a famous English writer who descended
the river in that year, saw &#8220;a small settlement called the
English prairie&#8221; where there was a &#8220;smelting-house and a
steam saw-mill.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> I incline to think the year 1836 was the
date of its beginning. In 1835 Hamilton was a candidate for
member of the Council from the western part of Michigan
Territory. His canvass was conducted in the lead mining
region and his advertisement appeared in the Galena
papers. He was elected to and became president of the
so-called &#8220;Rump&#8221; Council which met at Green Bay January
1, 1836 and sat for two weeks. During that session
the town of Cassville, on the Mississippi, was designated
as the territorial capital, Hamilton making the principal
argument in favor of the movement. Much interest was
manifested in internal improvements designed to develop a
through line of transportation via the Wisconsin and Fox
rivers.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The territory of Wisconsin was just being organized
by Congressional action and great expectations were
being awakened in consequence.</p>

<p>The miners and smelters had theretofore sold their lead
through the commission merchants of Galena, by whom it
was sent to St. Louis. But as new mines were opened farther
and farther north, the cost of transportation to Galena&mdash;by
means of the &#8220;sucker teams&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>&mdash;steadily increased. Moreover,
in the year 1836-37 the price of lead declined so
alarmingly that little of it was made and the smelters had
nearly all ceased to operate. Yet, it was felt that prices
would rise again promptly in response to the demand for
lead. In the same period, due no doubt partly to the hardships
of the miners and smelters, there was widespread and
loud dissatisfaction with the treatment accorded the lead
owners by the Galena middlemen. Efforts were made to
establish some other lead shipping port as a rival to Galena,
which helps to explain the rise of both Cassville and Potosi.</p>

<p>The inference from these facts is that Hamilton probably
thought he saw in a smelter located at the steamboat
landing at English Prairie a possibility of immediate profit,
even though margins were very narrow, and a chance to
build up a flourishing business. He could buy the cheapest
ore&mdash;that which was produced near the northern edge of
the lead region, Centerville, Wingville, and Highland. The
haul from those places would be short and all down grade
and if the mineral were taken direct from the mines there
would be no rehandling until the bars of pure lead were
ready to be dumped from the furnace floor into the hold
of the steamer. The teams employed to bring down the raw
mineral could carry freight back the fifteen or twenty miles
to the mines much more cheaply than it could be transported
from Galena or Cassville three or four times as far.
Finally, abundant supplies of wood were at hand to feed
the furnace, and French rivermen were a source from which
to recruit labor.</p>

<p>To an enterprising, speculative, acquisitive character
like Hamilton, who had no family to tie him to a particular
spot, such arguments would appeal strongly, and there is no
inherent reason why the venture should not have succeeded.
Hamilton operated the furnace, either personally
or by proxy, at least till 1838 and possibly longer, selling it
finally to Thomas Jefferson Parrish, whose principal mining
and smelting business was located at the head of Blue
River, afterwards Montfort.</p>

<p>The fact that Parrish owned the ground at the steamboat
landing and that in 1837 he was postmaster at English
Prairie (then called Savannah) suggests that he may have
been a partner in the business from the first and perhaps
local manager of the furnace. At all events, Hamilton
continued his business at Wiota and very soon cut loose
entirely from the English Prairie venture.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> That place,
under the name of Savannah or English Prairie, was a
calling place for river steamers as early as 1838 and is
scheduled as forty-one miles from the mouth of the Wisconsin.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
It was said that the only boat which regularly plied
on the river in that year was the <i>Science</i>, piloted by Captain
Clark, who made his first voyage in June, 1838.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> But there
were doubtless visits from steamers running to Fort Winnebago
(Portage) during that and earlier years.</p>

<p>In one of the Milwaukee papers for 1841 is a statement
that &#8220;four sucker teams&#8221; had brought in lead from Thomas
Parrish&#8217;s furnace &#8220;near Muscoday in Grant County.&#8221; This
reference has been taken as proof that the Muscoda furnace
was still in operation. I think it refers not to the Muscoda
furnace but to one of several furnaces Parrish was conducting
in the lead region near the heads of Blue River. The
phrase &#8220;near Muscoday&#8221; used as far from the lead region
as Milwaukee may very well mean some place fifteen or
twenty miles from the Wisconsin; and the word &#8220;near&#8221;
instead of &#8220;at&#8221; certainly excludes Muscoda itself. Setting
this evidence aside, there is no proof that the Muscoda furnace
was operated as late as 1841. Nor, on the other hand,
is there proof of its earlier discontinuance. We simply do
not know how long it was kept alive or how large a business
it developed at the &#8220;Landing.&#8221;</p>


<h3>SIGNS OF HARD TIMES</h3>

<p>Two things suggest that the little village failed to develop
a &#8220;boom&#8221; or even to gain a basis for healthy growth. These
are the land entries in the territory adjacent and the story
of the post office. Practically, there were no new entries of
land between the years 1841 and 1849. This is true for all
the townships in the tributary region&mdash;7, 8, and 9, range
1 W, and 7, 8, and 9, range 1 E. The post office under the
name of Savannah appears in the government list for the
first time in the report for 1837. At that time Thomas J.
Parrish was postmaster. In 1839 S. A. Holley was postmaster,
the office then being listed as English Prairie. The
postmaster&#8217;s compensation was $5.68. Charles Stephenson&#8217;s
compensation in 1841 was even smaller, $3.36, the net
proceeds of the office amounting to only $7.55. In 1843,
for the first time, the post office was called Muscoda. The
postmaster was Levi J. D. Parrish, who received as compensation
$9.29, the net proceeds of the office having risen
to $16.51.</p>

<p>It is probable that most of the seeming prosperity of
1843 was due to the presence of the land office, which had
been removed from Mineral Point to Muscoda in 1842.
Some have charged that the change was brought about
through James D. Doty&#8217;s influence in order to save the
town. If so, the scheme failed, for the land office promptly
went back to Mineral Point in 1843, and May 16, 1845, the
post office department discontinued the office at Muscoda.
Muscoda was not listed in the post office report for 1847 or
in the report for 1849. In 1851 it reappears, with James
Moore as postmaster. Now the compensation is $39.74 and
the net proceeds $53.09. The exact date of its restoration
is not given but it must have been as early as 1850, and
possibly 1849 or even 1847.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>


<h3>BEGINNINGS OF SETTLEMENT</h3>

<p>The reopening of the Muscoda post office, about 1850,
synchronizes with the first movement of pioneer farmers
into the good lands tributary to that place. A number of
tracts of land were purchased by actual settlers in this and
adjoining townships in the years 1849 to 1851. Indeed,
Conrad Kircher&#8217;s purchase dates from 1847. Charles Miller
and Emanuel Dunston bought land in 1849; Isaac Dale and
Moses Manlove in 1851. We know also that the Moore
family owned land at Muscoda as early as 1851. Across
the river, in township 9-1 W, Robert Galloway, William
Pickering, William and Andrew Miller, and two or three
others bought in 1849; several in 1850; and a few others before
1854, when the great rush came.</p>

<p>A similar story can be told for township 9-1 E (now
Orion) where J. H. Schuermann and Daniel Mainwaring
(settlers) bought lands in 1849; Albert C. Dooley in 1850;
and Jacob Roggy in 1851. One of the purchasers of 1848,
John H. Siegrist, was probably the earliest actual settler in
the township. A half dozen families bought in township
8-1 E as early as 1849; and a few others were added before
1854. A very few settlers were to be found in township
7-1 W prior to 1854, and while there were a good many
settlers and miners in township 7-1 E, the greater part of
that township was served from Highland where a post
office was established as early at least as 1847 and where
there was much lead mining activity, and from Blue River
which had a post office from 1839. These mining centers
doubtless drew their supplies from the steamers unloading at
Muscoda, for the road to the river at that point had been
open for many years, but settlement was more numerous
and local activity much more intense, as revealed by the
post office returns. The Highland post office led the Muscoda
post office in importance for just about ten years&mdash;from
1847 to 1856. With the coming of the railroad, Muscoda
drew ahead.</p>


<h3>THE RAILROAD</h3>

<p>If one had no other evidence than the sales of land at the
United States Land Office, it would still be clear that in the
years 1854 to 1856 something important was astir affecting
the value of lands in those townships (7, 8, and 9-1
W, and 7, 8, and 9-1 E) which pivot on Muscoda
as the trading point. For, while up to 1854 only scattering
tracts of land had been entered, and those largely by speculators
using military land warrants in making payment to the
government, by 1856 nearly every forty-acre subdivision of
first-rate land and much of the second-rate land also was
under private ownership. And the state lands in the townships
had also been purchased to the same extent. Besides,
the vast majority of the purchasers of government land
during those years were actual settlers, with only an occasional
speculator.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>These facts challenge attention and call for an explanation.
Wisconsin had been in course of settlement for about
two decades. The earliest settlements were in the southeastern
and eastern parts of the state where the economic
support was the market reached by the Great Lakes and
the Erie Canal; and in the southwestern section where the
basis of prosperity had been lead-mining. The lead found
its market mainly down the Mississippi, though increasingly
the superiority of the route open to the lake ports had
impressed itself upon the people.</p>

<p>At the legislative session of 1841-42 a bill was introduced
for the chartering of a railroad from Milwaukee, via
Madison, to Potosi. Despite continuous effort, the first
railroad bill to pass, in 1847, provided only for a railroad
from Milwaukee to Waukesha. In 1848 this was by law
extended to the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The agitation of plans for a railroad from Lake Michigan
to the Mississippi tended to give the lake route an overshadowing
importance in the popular mind. Actual construction
work on the Milwaukee-Waukesha section began
in 1849; that portion of the road was completed by the end
of the year 1850, and in another year it was practically
completed to Whitewater on Rock River. It reached Madison
in the year 1854.</p>

<p>The intention of the company had been to build to the
Wisconsin River so as to intercept steamboat transportation
at or near Arena. Thence the road might run along the
river to its mouth, or it might run along the ridge between
the Wisconsin and the south flowing streams, reaching the
Mississippi at some point, like Potosi, lower down. By
the year 1853 it had been determined to follow the Wisconsin
Valley route to the Mississippi, and during that summer
the line was surveyed from the mouth of Black Earth Creek
to Prairie du Chien.</p>

<p>It can easily be imagined how the clangor of railway
construction echoed in the minds and hearts of intending
settlers. That they should have watched, with greedy eye,
the reports of progress of the location of the road and
hurried away to the land office as soon as it was definitely
located, to buy the good lands adjacent to the right-of-way,
is a perfectly normal phenomenon. The township plats
showing original purchasers of the government land tell the
story. In section 1, township 7-1 W, four forty-acre tracts
were bought in 1854; eleven in 1855; and one in 1856. In
section 2, one in 1854; twelve in 1855; and two in 1857. A
single forty had been bought as early as 1847. The other
sections of that township show very similar dates and proportions
in the entries; the same is true of the other townships
of the group. The 1854 entrymen were those who
pursued the railway surveyors with keenest determination.
The slower ones came mainly in the two years following,
during which trains actually were put on the roadbed. In
October, 1856, the village of Muscoda, which had maintained
a precarious existence for twenty years, awoke to
newness of life at the sound of the puffing locomotive. And
the beginning of permanent prosperity for the village meant
the beginning of prosperity for the rural neighborhood
tributary to it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">POPULAR CENSORSHIP OF HISTORY TEXTS</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Joseph Schafer</span></p></div>


<p>Wisconsin has now a unique law on the subject of
school history texts. That law provides, section 1:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No history or other textbook shall be adopted for use or be in any
district school, city school, vocational school or high school which
falsifies the facts regarding the War of Independence or the War of 1812
or which defames our nation&#8217;s founders or misrepresents the ideals and
cause for which they struggled and sacrificed, or which contains propaganda
favorable to any foreign government.</p></blockquote>

<p>The method provided in other sections of the law for
banishing textbooks which have been adopted but which
are repugnant to the above provision is as follows: Upon
complaint of any five citizens, filed with the state superintendent
of public instruction, a hearing shall be arranged,
to be held before the state superintendent or his deputy,
in the county from which the complaint came. Previous
notice must have been given through the press to the
public and by mail to the complainants and to the publishers
of the textbook complained of. A decision must
be rendered within ten days. If the book shall be found
obnoxious to the provisions of the law, that fact shall be
noted by the state superintendent in the list of books for
schools which he publishes annually. Thereafter the
book so listed may be used only during the remainder of
the year in which the state superintendent publishes it as
proscribed. The penalty for retaining it beyond the time
limit, shall be the loss to the school or district concerned
of the state aid normally falling to its share.</p>

<p>The passage of this bill in the senate with only one vote
against it, created a good deal of surprise, which changed
to admiration for the oratorical powers of its author and
sponsor, Senator John Cashman of Manitowoc County,
when it was learned that his impassioned appeal to patriotism
figuratively swept senators &#8220;off their feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>History students can have no quarrel with the motive
assigned by Senator Cashman for the passage of this law.
He says: &#8220;The history of a nation is its proudest asset.
It includes the record of its great men, their ideals, sacrifices,
and achievements. To preserve that history in all its
original purity and teach it to the rising generations is a
nation&#8217;s first duty.&#8221; With every word in that stirring
exordium the historically minded man or woman will
cordially agree. Thoughtful persons, whether historians
or not, will also sympathize with Senator Cashman when
he undertakes to rebuke anything approaching levity in
characterizing the fathers of the Republic or captiousness
in criticizing their policies, motives, and achievements.
Unfortunately, there always have been among writers
some who display a certain air of &#8220;smartness&#8221; or superciliousness
which hardly comports with the inherent dignity
of the historian&#8217;s office, or with the aim of doing equal and
exact justice to all persons and to all causes discussed.
Yet it will probably be no light task to convince an impartial
umpire that writers of textbooks which have been adopted
for use in the schools, after careful scrutiny by boards of
education and other school officers responsible to the
people, have been guilty of &#8220;treason to the nation,&#8221; as
Senator Cashman seems to think has often been the case.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
The framers of the constitution, with wise prevision,
limited the application of the word &#8220;treason&#8221; in such a
way as to exclude that indefinite class of crimes known
elsewhere under the name of <i>constructive treason</i>, which
in England and other countries had provided a favorable
soil for plotters of revenge against individuals and in times
of high tension always yielded a sinister harvest of oppression
and suffering. So they defined treason against the
United States narrowly as consisting only in &#8220;levying
war against them or in adhering to their enemies, giving
them aid and comfort,&#8221; and they also provided that conviction
under a charge of treason could be secured only
on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act
or confession in open court.</p>

<p>This view of the fathers as relates to treason was of
course lost sight of during the Civil War, when in the
North it used to be fashionable for men to pillory as &#8220;fool&#8221;
or &#8220;traitor&#8221; (with an emphatic expletive) anyone who had
the temerity to vote the Democratic ticket; it was lost
sight of in the recent war when men were called traitors
because they refused to buy liberty bonds or because they
declared the draft a violation of the rights of the individual;
and it is likewise lost sight of when we condemn under
the term treason opinions on history which we may regard
as too favorable to our nation&#8217;s one-time enemies, or too
contemptuous of the characters or the acts of our own
distinguished men of a past age. It would be strange if
the impulses engendered by the war and the peace were
not reflected more or less in editions of books prepared
since 1917. It is probably true that some authors have
overstressed the &#8220;hands across the sea&#8221; sentiment, while
others perhaps lean unduly in an opposite direction. But
that any of them have been guilty of treasonable acts or
even intentions is what no one who knows the historical
profession can believe without the most explicit proof.</p>

<p>But this question of treason aside, the problem still
remains to determine what is the history of our country
&#8220;in all its original purity.&#8221; What shall be the test of purity
inasmuch as, happily, there is no established list of authorized
books or records from which writers must derive their
facts? Are they not compelled either to investigate each
point for themselves or to accept as probably correct the
results of other men&#8217;s investigations? To be sure, every
important event creates its own legend or tradition, and
such legends tend to be preserved and to be handed down
from generation to generation. But legends are not history.
No one worthy to rank as a careful historian would presume
to write the history of the Great War on the basis of legends
now crystallizing about it. No more can one write the history
of the Revolution on such a legendary basis. This view,
that much which once was thought to be history but was in
fact mere legend, is not in any sense new. James Russell
Lowell, who ranks among the very distinguished Americans
of the last generation, wrote, in 1864, that the early reports
of the battle of Lexington claimed for the Yankee minutemen
a non-resistant attitude.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Anglo Saxon could not fight without the law on his side. But
later, when the battle became a matter of local pride, the muskets that
had been fired at the Red coats under Pitcairn almost rivalled in number
the pieces of furniture that came over in the Mayflower. Indeed, whoever
has talked much with Revolutionary pensioners knows that those
honored veterans were no less remarkable for imagination than for
patriotism. It should seem that there is nothing on which so little
reliance can be placed as facts, especially when related by one who saw
them. It is no slight help to our charity to recollect that, in disputable
matters, every man sees according to his prejudices, and is stone blind
to whatever he did not expect or did not mean to see. Even where no
personal bias can be suspected, contemporary and popular evidence
is to be taken with great caution, so exceedingly careless are men as
to exact truth, and such poor observers, for the most part of what goes
on under their eyes.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is hardly necessary at this late day to insist that no
writer is justified in building his narrative of events on
unverified tradition. He must try to penetrate to the
truth that lies behind the legend (which in some cases
will differ very widely from the legend itself). It is no easy
task at best to perform a successful piece of historical
research, and the questions on which final agreements
have been reached are not numerous. Accordingly, if
the law should be so construed as to enforce banishment
from the schools of any book which can be proved incorrect
in some of its alleged facts without regard to their importance,
no textbooks will be left in the schools, for none are
impeccable. True, the Cashman law would condemn only
for falsifying the history of the Revolutionary War and
the War of 1812, leaving four other foreign wars in which
our country has engaged, and the great Civil War, to be
treated without other restraint than that contained in the
last clause of section 1, denouncing propaganda in favor
of any foreign government. But under that sole provision
it might still prove embarrassing for a writer to tell the
truth about the Mexican War and possibly the others also,
for the term propaganda&mdash;as the whole world has learned
lately&mdash;is a most elastic one. Presumably, the propaganda
test applies as well to other phases of history as to the
military phases, wherefore an author of a textbook is apt,
under a strict construction of this law, to be hauled into court
on the charge of propaganda if he should consider it his
duty to say a single thing in commendation of any other
nation. For, will there not always be found, in any school
district, five citizens whose views collide with those of the
author; and if so, what is to prevent a case being called?
Surely a word in favor of France would be resented by
some; a word in favor of Great Britain would be resented
by others; a word in favor of Germany would offend still
others; and so on through the list. In the present mournful
state of general unrest and want of confidence among
nations, an author would tread unsafely on any ground outside
the &#8220;three-mile limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>It does not follow from the fact that under the law it is
easy to bring cases, that convictions would be equally easy.
Presumably the state superintendent has had knowledge
of all books now in use in the schools and, in effect if not
in form, has approved them. This he would not have done
had he considered any of them purveyors of treason or
excessively faulty in statement. Moreover, as judge in
cases that may arise under this law, the superintendent
will be bound to take judicial notice of some things. For
example, it is common knowledge that no history text
is perfect either on its factual side, in its literary qualities,
or in the author&#8217;s perspective of events; that few writers
display at all times perfect taste, and none perfect judgment,
in their criticisms of men and their comments on
historical actions and movements; that a given textbook
may be valuable, despite minor defects in all of the above
points, by reason of its superior arrangement, its psychological
adaptation to children&#8217;s needs, and the success
with which it communicates to them the main features
and the spirit of American history. He will also be obliged
to rule that the truth is not malicious propaganda and he
is bound to maintain an author&#8217;s right to liberty of research.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that if a book is palpably and
grossly inaccurate; if it gives the child a wholly erroneous
view of history; if it is crassly censorious of America&#8217;s
great men; if it is written in a spirit tending to destroy
American ideals; if it tends to make boys and girls ashamed
of American character and achievements, not in exceptional
instances here and there, but generally; then there would
hardly be a question about the duty of getting rid of it
with all convenient promptness. But would it not be
strange if, with the superintendent and other educational
experts on guard, such a book had got itself adopted?
On general principles one would expect that only in the
rarest cases would this law come into operation; for it
ought not to be easy for a thoroughly unworthy book to
elude the critical eyes of publishers, editors, school superintendents,
teachers, and school boards, to be finally
detected and exposed by some school patron or other
private citizen. No doubt such cases are possible, but
one could hardly conceive them to be of common occurrence.
Misgivings are aroused, therefore, by the report that at the
legislative hearing Senator Cashman denounced, by name,
five well known and widely used textbooks.</p>

<p>If the Senator&#8217;s historical views, as published in the
<i>Senate Journal</i> under date of March 1, 1923, are intended
to be made the platform in a campaign to purify the history
teaching of our schools, the upshot may prove widely
different from what is now anticipated; for among those
views, the derivation of which is not indicated, are some
which it would be difficult to find expressed in any existing
textbook. For example, Senator Cashman holds that
our country is indebted to Holland &#8220;for town and county
representation in a legislature.&#8221; Americans have long
been taught that, in the picturesque phrase of John Fiske,
&#8220;self-government <i>broke out</i> in Virginia&#8221; in 1619 by reason
of the fact that these people were English. We are aware
of no investigations which have brought forth evidence
compelling the abandonment of that view, though some
very extravagant claims have been made for the Dutch
influence upon both colonial politics and colonial education.
He also holds that &#8220;our free public school system came
from Prussia.&#8221; If by this were meant merely that Prussian
influence has been felt in the creation of a system of state
supervision of education, and in the strengthening of a
school system already in existence, we would gladly concur.
But the statement is too sweeping to admit of such an interpretation.
Wisconsin Germans ought to be very glad to
assign to New England colonies and states the chief influence
in giving us the public school system because, in the present
state of research, that appears to be where the credit belongs.
To all that the Senator says about the selection of immigrants
for America, the development in the colonies themselves
of a new and vivid love of liberty which found
expression in the Declaration of Independence, the stupid
tyranny of George III, and the heroic sufferings and
achievements of patriots in the Revolution, we utter a
hearty Amen; realizing, of course, that his statement
is necessarily a crowded summary, cast in oratorical mould,
and not designed as a complete exposition of his views.
But, in thus concurring we do not yield up our sympathy
with the aphorism of Edmund Burke, that in their reaction
to tyranny the colonists &#8220;are descendants of Englishmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same reservations might be made with reference
to Senator Cashman&#8217;s statement on the constitution. And
yet a fair interpretation of what he says on that subject
compels us to class him with those extreme worshipers of
that document who, like the authors of the New York
teachers&#8217; test oath, would maintain the constitution,
unchanged, at any cost. Speaking of the fathers and
their work, he says: &#8220;Then they wrote and the states
adopted the supreme law of the land, the American constitution,
the most sublime public document that ever came
forth from the mind and soul of man, establishing a system
of government based upon the consent of the governed,
with religious liberty protected, inherent rights guaranteed,
<i>to be written in indestructible letters into the pages of the
nation&#8217;s laws</i>.&#8221; [Editor&#8217;s italics.] It is a well known
view of the present progressives, as it was of the framers
themselves, that, great as was the original constitution,
it was still far from being perfect. Also, most progressives
now accept in principle the conclusions of Charles A.
Beard, the historian whose recent investigations on this
point are now well known, that the constitution represents
a partial reaction from the democracy of the Revolution,
and was designed in part to set limitations upon the popular
will. While venerating the constitution, progressives in
the main believe that such restrictions as the legislative
election of senators, the appointment and life tenure of
judges (some would include the mode of electing the
president), were intentionally anti-democratic, and that
these and other defects which time has revealed ought to
be subject to modification whenever the people desire the
changes. The mode of amendment having been designed
to make changes difficult, or impossible (though in recent
years several changes have been adopted), leading progressives
have long held that that fundamental article
ought to be amended first in order to facilitate other
changes. This was Justice John B. Winslow&#8217;s opinion,
put forth in 1912; it was the burden of an important plank
in the La Follette national platform the same year; that
doctrine was preached, at least in spirit, by the late President
Roosevelt. In short, it is a progressive principle that the
constitution must cease to be a fetish&mdash;a dead hand upon
the present and the future&mdash;and must be adjusted, from
time to time, to existing social, economic, and political
conditions. The document represents, for the time, a
mighty triumph of constructive statesmanship, so progressive
leaders believe, and it should not be changed &#8220;for
light or transient causes,&#8221; much less revolutionized, but
&#8220;it was designed for a rural or semi-rural state.&#8221; The
men who made it &#8220;however able could not anticipate or
solve the new problems of life and government which have
come upon us in the last half century.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>To follow Senator Cashman&#8217;s outline of American
history into the recent period to the all-engrossing event
of the World War and America&#8217;s participation therein
would be fruitless. Not one of us can conscientiously
claim to be an impartial investigator with respect to things
which have wrenched our souls. We cannot abdicate our
own personalities. In treating the war, all that any historian
at present could hope to do would be to state his
views with becoming restraint and concede that those
views may ultimately prove to be quite wrong. A censorship
law of fifty years hence (if our people shall then still adhere
to the censorship idea) would be sure to condemn the
teaching of what some of us now piously believe with reference
to this feature of history; just as a censorship law of
today, if it included in its scope the Civil War, would condemn
the teaching of some things which nearly one-half
the voters of Wisconsin sincerely believed in 1864. &#8220;Time
is the great sifter and winnower of truth,&#8221; and we must
consent to leave these matters to the investigators of our
grandchildren&#8217;s generation. Yet the gravest danger to be
feared from the law we are now discussing lies in the psychological
probability that every second man&#8217;s opinion of a
given history will be based not on what the author says
about the Revolution, or the Constitution, or the War of
1812, but on what he says about the recent war and the
League of Nations. In other words, the reader who is
prejudiced against an author on account of his last chapter,
which is almost sure to be unsatisfactory to many, will
find the first, the middle, and all other chapters reeking
with faults, and this even while personally he may be
unconscious of having imbibed a prejudice at all.</p>

<p>There is a possibility that, as an engine for expelling
books now used, the law will become a dead letter, first,
because it may prove unexpectedly difficult for a dissatisfied
citizen to persuade four others to act with him in making
complaint, which however is not probable; second, because
of the clamor of those in the district who are not keen for
or against the book, but who realize that if it is thrown out
all old copies will be worthless and they will have to pay
for new books at the opening of the next school year; third,
because the first cases brought may go against the complainants
and discourage others from multiplying complaints.
But, the popular psychology being what it is,
there is an equal chance that the law may foster a widespread
disposition to attack history books, geography books,
civics books, and even readers; that it may keep educational
matters in a state of turmoil, engendering much social
bitterness due to the clashing of parties and interests
over questions raised in the school-book fights. In such
controversies teachers would be the first to suffer, because
their opinions would be called for at once, which would
place them between two fires; and no surer way could be
found to degrade the social influence of our schools than
by keeping the teachers in a state of perpetual anxiety.</p>

<p>We have reason to think that Senator Cashman, an
acknowledged friend and promoter of education, would
deeply deplore such a result. If he had anticipated anything
of the kind, doubtless he would have refrained from offering
his bill. But laws, like children, when they get out of hand,
have a way of surprising their progenitors. However,
we have the law and must use it to the best ends.</p>

<p>If every one in position of leadership or authority in
relation to it&mdash;and among those are members of this Society&mdash;shall
feel a responsibility for guiding discussion into
proper channels; if debate on school-book questions shall
be kept not merely free but also parliamentary in form and
spirit; if we all insist that differences of view must be
treated tolerantly; if we can secure from the public toward
the arguments and facts in these cases a measure of that
openness of mind which characterizes the American juror
sworn to try a case fairly on the evidence, it may be possible
to mitigate or prevent the evils apprehended.</p>

<p>And if, without discouraging research, the law shall
merely enforce through future adoptions the idea that good
taste is as obligatory upon the textbook maker as good
manners are upon the private individual, one point will
have been gained. We trust this may not be won at the
expense of a disposition to whittle down the truth to fit a
supposed demand, or that it will result in substituting
books written by dishonest or spineless persons for those
written by men and women of real character and scholarship.</p>

<p>In the midst of the late war the school supervisors of
a western state discovered what they believed to be propaganda
favorable to one of America&#8217;s enemies, and demanded
the expulsion of the book from the schools. The superintendent,
being a wise and thoughtful man, prepared and
printed a page of corrective criticism, which all teachers
were asked to paste in the accused book and to teach to the
children with the regular text. By that simple device he
saved the people of the state many thousands of dollars
which would have been paid for an inferior text, if the
book had been expelled. If the law shall permit such a
handling of the borderline cases, does it not seem that in a
time when we are at peace with all nations, we could act
with equal calmness, equal justice to authors or publishers,
and equal regard for the interests of the people who have to
buy school books?</p>

their prating of antislavery, are further removed from actual human freedom than the
slaveholders themselves. The occurrences of the past year, during which the Shanghais

correspondent of the Prairie du Chien <i>Patriot</i>, Feb. 23, 1847, who says: &#8220;The mail from
... Mineral Point to Muskoda goes but once a week. There is no post office in Richland
County; their post office is at Muskoda.&#8221; The census of 1846 assigns to the northern
district of Grant County 1,482 persons. It is possible to identify in the lists of heads of
families six families whose later homes were at or near Muscoda. They are John D. Parrish,
James Smith, Manuel Denston [Dunston?], Thomas Waters, Wm. Garland, and
Richard Hall. All of these are met with again in the census returns for Dec. 1, 1847,
where the &#8220;Muscoday Precinct of Grant County&#8221; is listed separately. The precinct seems
to have included townships 7 and 8-1 W and townships 7 and 8-2 W, or the present towns
of Muscoda, Castle Rock, Watterstown, and Hickory Grove. That precinct is credited with
thirteen families aggregating 77 persons. Aside from the families mentioned above
(except Denston) we find the names of S. [R?] Carver, J. Moore, N. Head, M. Manlove,
D. Manlove, I. Dale, S. Smith, D. Smith, and A. Mills. Garland is credited with a family
consisting of nine males and two females, which confirms the statement in the county
history that he was managing a hotel in Muscoda at that time. Moses Manlove has a
family of seven males and five females which suggests a second hotel or &#8220;boarding house.&#8221;
Most of the other families mentioned probably lived some distance from Muscoda on
farms. Aside from those in Muscoda Precinct of Grant County, several families living
in Iowa County, township 8 1-E, must have depended for their supplies either on Muscoda
or on Highland. These were John Pettygrove, A. Palmer, A. Bolster, three Knowlton
families, Mathias Schafer, Henry Gottschall, Vincent Dziewanawski, and the two Wallbridges.
If Richland County settlers really were, as reported, getting their mail at
Muscoda, that would mean, according to the census, that 235 persons living north of the
Wisconsin must have done some trading at that place. The county history says the old
log house once used as the land office served in 1847 as the store.</p></div>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
